00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
奇怪的相遇

1
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,978
诶呀，哈楼啊！你是史蒂夫？
Yeah, hello. You're Steve?

2 
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:55,993
史蒂文，史蒂文，好啊！
Steven. Hi.

3
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:58,130
－ 坐吧！
－罗柏托？
- Sit down.
- Roberto?

4
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,665
－我现在特亢奋！
－是吗？！
- I'm all wound up.
- Yeah?

5
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,792
－你挺亢奋？我也是。
You're wound up? I'm wound up, too.

6
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,260
－对对对
－特亢奋。
- Yes.
- All wound up.

7
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,064
－你喝啥呢？咖啡？
－对！咖啡！
- What are you drinking? Coffee?
- Coffee, yes.

8
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,308
－对我特有用，你呢？
－我爱咖啡！
- Very good for me. For you?
- I love coffee.

9
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,685
－诶呀！你也喜欢？
－倍儿喜欢！
- You love it, too?
- I love it.

10
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:19,214
－史蒂夫！
－史蒂文。
- Steve!
- Steven.

11
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,861
我喜欢这东西
I love coffee.

12
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,230
你是做什么的？
What do you do?

13
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,394
你知道，我只是放松一下随便坐坐，也许抽根儿烟什么的...
You know, I just relax, sit around,
maybe have a cigarette.

14
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:32,497
香烟...咖啡... 我觉得这是一个挺棒的组合。
Cigarettes and coffee...
I think go together very good.

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,934
哥们儿，你不觉得自己喝的有点儿多么？
You think you drink too much of it?

16
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,486
不，咖啡有利于身体健康。
No. Coffee is good for health.

17
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,990
我喜欢睡前喝
I like to drink before I go to sleep.

18
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:43,120
睡前我会喝很多，这样梦会更快更有趣儿
I drink a lot of coffee before I go to sleep
so I can dream faster.

19
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:45,743
在梦里我像印地500里的摄像机
I can dream like
when they put a camera on the Indy 500...

20
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:49,075
摄像机在赛车上，画面快的像小鞭子在耳边抽
唰～唰～唰～唰～
when they put a camera in the car,
and it's just whipping by like that.

21
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:51,150
梦接梦～梦接梦～梦接梦
Dream after dream after dream after dream.

22
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:53,610
第二天别人问我“你都梦什么了？”
People ask me the next day,
"What did you dream about?"

23
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:57,264
我说“我没时间！没时间告诉你！亲”
I say, "I don't have time.
I don't have time to tell you this."

24
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:06,863
－你抽烟吗？
－只在喝的时候抽。喝咖啡的时候。
- Do you smoke?
- Only when I drink. Coffee.

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,809
你认识我妈？！
Do you know my mother?

26
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,514
－我认识你妈？
－认识吗？
- Do I know your mother?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:15,792
我不觉得我认识你母亲
I don't know. I don't think so.

28
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,729
－他们应该做些咖啡冰块儿会更好，你觉得呢？
－太对了
- Coffee. They should freeze it, you know?
- Yes.

29
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:23,308
咖啡倒在模子里放上小棍儿，做成咖啡棒冰给小孩儿
Fill an ice-cube tray with coffee
and put sticks in it, for kids.

30
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,543
这事儿可以从娃娃抓起，比如他们玩儿的时候就可以落实
So they can start when they're kids,
when they're playing and stuff.

31
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:29,197
像棒冰一样！咖啡因棒冰！
Like a popsicle. A caffeine popsicle.

32
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:32,048
非常好！！！我一句都没听懂。对，没听懂。
Very good. I don't understand nothing. Yes.

33
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,488
－你听我说话了吗？
－啥？
- Can you hear me?
- What?

34
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,376
你能听清我说话吗？这儿实在太吵了。
Can you hear me? It's very loud over here.

35
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,736
你是不是听我说话很困难？或许换一下位置能好？
You having trouble hearing me?
Maybe we should switch.

36
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:58,952
对！very三克油！我很乐意！
Yes, thank you very much. I'd like to switch.

37
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:03,469
嗯～这里不错！
Good here.

38
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:12,490
－咋样？
－呃～我还是比较喜欢刚才的位置...
- Good?
- I kind of liked it better over there.

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,534
－那...那你...
－你想么？
- You go...
- Do you mind?

40
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,639
啊～～～对！我也是！对！
Yes, me, too. I prefer, yes.

41
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,459
史蒂文，对。
Steven, yes.

42
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,630
－你什么时候走？
－离开美国？
- When do you leave?
- The United States?

43
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:39,911
不，是这里
No, here.

44
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:43,907
事实上我快要走了。因为，我约了牙医。
I have to leave soon, actually.
I have a dentist appointment.

45
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,158
但我不太想去。我不喜欢看牙。
But I don't want to go.
I don't like the dentist.

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,606
我想我该走了。
I gotta go, I guess.

47
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,489
－对。
－我太多次没去了。
- Yes.
- I haven't gone in a while.

48
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,971
好...那你不去吗？
Good. You don't go?

49
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,804
－呃！没办法，我得去！但实在提不起精神。
－那还是不去？
- I should go, but I don't feel like going.
- No?

50
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:11,911
大兄弟，我有空，特别闲！
Steven, I am free, very free.

51
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,949
你要代我去？
You wanna go for me?

52
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,644
哦吼吼～～very三克油！！！
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,016
－你要去看牙？
－恩那！我可以代你去。
- You wanna go to the dentist?
- Yes, I can go for you.

54
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,195
太好了！
Great.

55
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,040
－给你地址
－好
- Here's the address.
- Good.

56
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:25,314
好，特别好！
Good. Very good.

57
00:05:25,386 --> 00:05:27,490
－这是他的名字
－啊对，四点半！
- The name of the guy.
- Yeah, 4:30.

58
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:31,847
－史蒂文，very三克油！
－这都不是事儿！
- Steven, thank you very much.
- No problem.

59
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:34,016
－你真没事儿？
－放心吧。谢啦！
- You don't mind?
- No, thank you.

60
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,293
对！看牙医！你懂得！
Dentist appointment, very good.

61
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,484
－史蒂夫，很抱歉，我得走了！
－史蒂文！！！
- I have to go. I am sorry, Steve.
- Steven.

62
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,290
史蒂夫，我必须去看牙医了，已经迟到了！
Steve, I have to go to the dentist. I am late.

63
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:48,130
－三克油，艾克丝Q丝米，骚瑞
－别着急！别迟到！
- Thank you, excuse me. Sorry.
- Take it easy, don't be late.

64
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,611
－很高兴认识你！
－嗯嗯我也是！从某种角度上吧。
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too, in a way.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
双胞胎

65
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,234
我们怎么就来了孟菲斯？
What are we doing in Memphis, anyway?

66
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,611
－来这儿是你的主意
－你的！
- It was your idea to come here.
- Your idea.

67
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:43,011
我的？！这是你的主意好吧！
It was my idea? It was your idea.

68
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,999
真他妈搞
Very funny.

69
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,440
别在这儿抽你的旱烟好不
Don't smoke those sawdust cigarettes
in here.

70
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,032
讨厌你卷来卷去
I hate those things.

71
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:05,016
－咋的？
－难道你是山炮牛仔？
- So what?
- What are you, a cowboy?

72
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,537
－这是鲜的！鲜的烟丝！
－才不是！爷这才是鲜的！
- These are fresh. This is fresh tobacco.
- No, this is fresh.

73
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,082
－爷这是最牛逼的至尊加鲜烟！
－你那就是堆粑粑！你是不是脑袋让驴踢了？
- This is the stupid dope fresh cigarettes.
- That stuff is stale. What are you, crazy?

74
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,415
－没有
－闭了！
- I'm not crazy.
- Shut up.

75
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:22,711
你们怎么样？要续杯吗？
How we doing here? Need a refill?

76
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,093
－要
－不要
- Yeah.
- No.

77
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,364
－先生？
－要！
－哦～要
- Sir?
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,960
－诶呀！我擦
－对不起
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,349
－嘿！哥们儿你在干嘛？
－哦～非常抱歉！
- Come on, what are you doing, man?
- Damn, I'm sorry about that.

80
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,155
谁爱结帐谁结帐吧，这地儿糟透了！
Let's not even pay the check.
This place is terrible.

81
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,129
你们不需要其他的吗？
This all you're gonna have?

82
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,500
－给我火！
－喝咖啡只抽烟
- Give me a light.
- Just coffee and cigarettes?

83
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,486
是不是会对身体有影响？
That's not too healthy, is it now?

84
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,332
－需要我上一个三明治之类的吗？
－不
- Can I get you a sandwich or something?
- No.

85
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:56,920
－你们是本地人吗？
－不
- Y'all from around here?
- No.

86
00:07:58,142 --> 00:07:59,570
你们是兄妹？
Are you brother and sister?

87
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,856
－是
－不是
- Yes.
- No.

88
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:04,538
你们是双胞胎？
Are you two twins?

89
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:05,815
－是
－不是
- Yes.
- No.

90
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:07,385
是，我们是
Yes, we are.

91
00:08:07,774 --> 00:08:10,741
我想也是
你知道你们看起来像谁吗？
I thought so.
You know who y'all remind me of?

92
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:12,796
－谁？
－海克和杰克
- Who?
- Heckle and Jeckle.

93
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:15,251
擦
Shit.

94
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:18,422
你知道内两只会说话的喜鹊吗？
You know, the talking magpies?

95
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,245
好吧，那谁是那只坏鸟？
一定有只是坏的是吧？
Anyway, who's the evil twin?
That's the way it works, right?

96
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,210
－这咖啡是泥巴口味的！
－真是！
- This coffee tastes like mud.
- Really.

97
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:33,496
你觉得哪个看起来是坏的？
Which one of us do you think
looks like the evil one?

98
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:37,074
我觉得他是，对吗？
他的眼神儿看起来很贼
I'd say he's the evil one, right?
He's got the evil eye.

99
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:41,304
－我只是闹着玩儿
－最好是这样
- I'm only kidding.
- You better be.

100
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:45,328
因为你们是双胞胎所以，你知道，我只是想说点儿什么
You know, I just thought of something,
with you two being twins and all.

101
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,823
－你们已经去过格雷斯兰（猫王的旧宅）吗？
－没
- Did y'all go to Graceland yet?
- No.

102
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,589
你们应该去，那儿很屌！
You should. It's real cool.

103
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:51,959
－你们介意我坐一下吗？
－对，我介意！
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes, I do.

104
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:55,056
对，你可以坐。但是你在休息吗？
Yes, you can sit down.
What are you, on a break?

105
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,926
不很确定，但是现在比较清闲
嘿～我有个主意，你可以帮助我。
Not really, but it's kind of slow.
Tell you what, you can help me out.

106
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:02,993
你只需要坐在这里，这样我的老板就看不到我了。
Just stay right there. You got me covered
and my boss can't see me.

107
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:06,544
坏人做坏事，对吗？
It's his evil nature, right?

108
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,331
不管怎样，我真心想和你们聊天
Anyway, what I just thought of:

109
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:12,335
你们知道猫王有一个孪生兄弟吗？
Do you know that
Elvis Presley's got a twin brother?

110
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:16,149
他叫杰西·盖伦。你知道，猫王的中间名叫艾伦。
Yeah, his name is Jesse Garon.
You know, Elvis' middle name is Aaron.

111
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:20,077
艾伦，盖伦...算了
反正大家觉得他出生时就已经死了
Aaron, Garon. Anyway,
everybody thinks that he died at birth.

112
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:21,809
但...我的观点是...
But my theory is...

113
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:25,259
其实他妈不想要俩孩子，这不是她意料之中的。
that his mother didn't wanna raise two kids.
She wasn't expecting twins.

114
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,701
她没那么多钱抚养两个孩子，所以她得送出去一个。
She couldn't afford to raise both.
She gave one away.

115
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:32,109
于是她就送走了一个，所以杰西可能在阿肯色州或密西西比州或其他什么地方长大了。
She just sent one off. So Jesse grew up
in Arkansas, or Mississippi, or something.

116
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:35,858
他不知道他有一个兄弟，猫王！
但是有一天，大概1968年或69年...
So he didn't know he had a brother, Elvis.
But one day, like, 1968 or '69...

117
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:39,373
当盖伦照镜子的时候他发现“他妈的，我看起来很像猫王！”
he's looking at himself in the mirror
and says, "Damn, I look like Elvis."

118
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,031
所以他来到了孟菲斯，打算找到猫王
So he comes to Memphis, looks up Elvis.

119
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:45,450
当猫王看到盖伦的时候他说“嘿！你是我兄弟，简直不敢相信”
Elvis sees him, he says,
"Yeah, you're my brother. I can't believe it!"

120
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:48,078
“你怎么样？我能为你做点什么吗？”
"How you doing? What can I do for you?"

121
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,799
他的兄弟盖伦说“哇噢～我不知道。”
And his brother says, "Well, I don't know.

122
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,683
“或许，我可以变成你一晚。”
"Sure would be nice
to be you for one night."

123
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,394
于是，有一场猫王的音乐会其实是他的兄弟在唱。
So Elvis had this concert
where his brother sang.

124
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:02,129
当时，他们也不清楚这样可不可以骗过别人
但，该死的，他的兄弟简直和他一模一样！
They tried to see if they could trick people.
Damn if he didn't sound like his brother!

125
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,111
于是，猫王有一个主意。
Then Elvis had an idea.

126
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,049
“我实在是受够了做一个歌手，让盖伦来代替我吧。”
"I'm tired of the music scene.
I'll send him out on tour."

127
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:10,700
但，天大的错误！之后他的兄弟开始出入拉斯维加斯这样的地方。
Big mistake, because it was his brother
who started to go to Vegas...

128
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:14,316
穿衣风格大转变，换成了大领子，白连体服，小坎肩。
and wear them big collars,
the white jumpsuits, and the capes.

129
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:17,868
猫王才不可能穿成这样。
后来他的兄弟越来越胖！
Elvis wouldn't do that.
And it was his brother who got really fat.

130
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:21,550
你懂得，当你所有食物都变成黄油炒香蕉三明治！
You know, eating those
banana-fried butter sandwiches and all.

131
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:25,196
他的经纪人说“我们必须把这家伙干掉
他真的不可以继续做猫王了”
The Colonel said, "We gotta get rid
of this guy. He can't be Elvis anymore."

132
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,778
于是，他们开始给他吃药。
我觉得这药足以杀了他。
So they started feeding him pills.
I think they killed him.

133
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,773
那？你想表达什么？
这有什么好笑的？
So what? What are you saying?
What's the punch line?

134
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:38,728
－你们是猫王的粉丝？
－不！
- Y'all are Elvis fans?
- No.

135
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:44,933
那你想知道一些关于猫王的事情吗？
我可以告诉你一些。
You wanna hear something about Elvis?
I'll tell you something about him.

136
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,878
－你知道奥提斯·布莱克威尔？
－不知道，女士
- You ever heard of Otis Blackwell?
- No, ma'am.

137
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:50,799
－你知道小帕克尔?
－不知道，女士
- You ever heard of Junior Parker?
- No, ma'am.

138
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:54,537
对，我觉得你也不认识。
你知道猫王的音乐是从他们那剽窃的么？哥们儿
Yeah, I didn't think so.
You know, Elvis robbed their music, man.

139
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:58,863
他只给他们的音乐付10美金，还有更多的黑人音乐也是这样。
He paid them $10 for their music,
and all these other black musicians, too.

140
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:01,797
－猫王的这些事儿我都知道
－正好符合我的观点
- That's what I think of Elvis.
- Here's where my theory fits.

141
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:04,741
因为我知道这不是真的猫王，这是他的兄弟。
I don't think it was Elvis.
I think it was his brother.

142
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,985
所以，如果是他的兄弟做了这些，就没问题是么？
So in that case, it's all right?

143
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,068
我最欣赏猫王说的一句话“黑人只可以为我刷鞋”
My favorite Elvis quote is, "The only thing
colors can do for me is shine my shoes."

144
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:18,372
我觉得这不是我的“王”说的！
你看这一定是他的坏兄弟干的好事儿！
I don't think the King said that.
See, I think it was his evil twin.

145
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:23,399
丹尼，你在那里干什么？？
很多人都在等你！赶紧过来！
Danny, what you doing over there?
You got tables to wait on. Come on.

146
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,219
－我会很快回来！
－你小心点别被炒了！哥们儿
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, don't get fired, man.

147
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:29,192
迷迷糊糊的山炮
Slaphappy hillbilly.

148
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,207
干杯～
Cheers.

149
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,744
这儿怎么有股怪味儿？
Something smells funny in here.

150
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:44,036
你是不是穿的我的衣服？
Is that my shirt you got on?

151
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:47,846
不，我不这么想。
No, I don't think so.

152
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,337
对，一定是！
这味道一定不是我的！
Yeah, I think it is.
This doesn't smell like me.

153
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:51,655
是吗？你是什么味道？
Yeah? What do you smell like?

154
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:53,828
我的味道像我，但这味儿绝对不是我！
I smell like me,
and this doesn't smell like me.

155
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,680
－我的味道也像我。
－但是这味道像你！
- I smell like me, too.
- But this smells like you.

156
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:58,570
这是因为我就是我！
That's because I am me.

157
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:00,896
你穿的是不是我的衣服？
Is that my shirt?

158
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,491
－为什么你总是要学我？
－我没学你！
- Why you always copying me, anyway?
- I'm not copying you.

159
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:06,050
－为什么你不能穿出自己的风格？
－我有我自己的风格！
- Why don't you get your own style?
- I have my own style.

160
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:09,634
不！你总是学我！
你的风格就是学我的风格！
No, you're always copying me.
Your style is my style because you copy it.

161
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,843
－这是我的风格！
－不！这不是你的风格！
- It's my style.
- No, it's not your style.

162
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,597
服务像粑粑，咖啡像粑粑，音乐还烂到家了！
Service is bad, the coffee is bad,
the music sucks.

163
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,713
这是我的鞋
Those are my shoes.

164
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,509
－这是我的鞋
－这是我的鞋
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my shoes.

165
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,584
－这是我的鞋
－这是我另一双鞋
- These are my shoes.
- Those are my other shoes.

166
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,605
放屁
Bullshit.

167
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,000
加州的某个角落

167
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:10,174
－嗨！
－嗨，汤姆！
- Hey.
- Hey, Tom.

168
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:12,857
－好吧
－很高兴你能来
- All right.
- I'm glad you could make it.

169
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:15,193
你在这儿
You are here.

170
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,308
你知道你可以叫我吉姆
You know, you can call me Jim.

171
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:22,333
我的意思是，你懂的，我的朋友叫我什么的都有，吉姆，吉米，伊吉，吉吉。
I mean, you know, my friends call me Jim,
or Jimmy, or Iggy, or Jiggy.

172
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,154
叫我伊吉
Call me Iggy.

173
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:29,662
行，没问题，你说了算
我无所谓，吉姆，伊吉...
Okay, all right, whichever way you go.
I'll go either way, Jim or Iggy...

174
00:13:29,732 --> 00:13:31,739
叫我伊吉
You call me Iggy.

175
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:36,449
看，我很抱歉我迟到了，吉姆
路上出了连环车祸
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Jim.
Boy, four-car pileup.

176
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:40,575
今早上9点我接生了一个小孩儿
I delivered a baby this morning
at about 9:00.

177
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:44,351
我在路上救死扶伤来着...
I was saving lives,
I was out there on the highway, it was...

178
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,422
你知道，在路边做手术情况很糟糕的
You know, there's nothing worse
than roadside surgery.

179
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:51,068
你没有合适的医疗设备...这基本相当于杀人...
You don't have your own tools,
and it's just... It's murder.

180
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:55,009
我用一个圆珠笔做气管切开术...
I performed a tracheotomy
with a ballpoint pen and...

181
00:13:57,026 --> 00:13:58,487
这太复杂了！
I've been busy.

182
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,682
等等！你是医生？
Wait a minute. You're a doctor?

183
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,428
对，我是医生
Yeah, I'm a doctor.

184
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,327
音乐和医学，这两样是我最得意的
Music and medicine, really.
It's really been my thing.

185
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:15,767
两者可以相融，我活在它们之中
It's combining the two
and living in that place where they overlap.

186
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:20,860
很多人说通过我的音乐就知道我是搞医的，
我的意思是...我也不知道该怎么形容...
A lot of people say it shows up in the music.
I don't know. I mean, it's...

187
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,993
哇噢，那好，我能明白
Well, okay. Yeah, I can see that.

188
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:29,369
对，是的，可以联想到整个音乐都是很有组织有规律的...
Yeah, okay. I think the organization
and the whole thing...

189
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,747
－有高尚的情操，我猜...
－嗯嗯～
- The humanity, I guess.
- Yeah.

190
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:35,353
－高尚威严的音乐，令人心生敬重
－对，心生敬重
- The humanity of the thing. The regard.
- Yeah, the regard.

191
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:40,155
－我猜今天对你来说是个大日子
－是的，治了一早上！
- I guess it's a big day for you, then.
- It is. It was a medical morning.

192
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,807
－其余的人怎么样？
－大家不错
- Everybody's all right?
- Everybody's fine.

193
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,972
我看你来了有一会儿了吧
You've been here awhile, I see.

194
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:49,721
我在这儿，喝了点儿咖啡...
I've been here. Drinking a little coffee.

195
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:52,154
－嗯～我看到了～
－也给你点了
- Yeah, I see.
- I ordered you some.

196
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,183
也给我点了？
You ordered for me?

197
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:59,546
可以吗？要吗？
I mean, is it cool? Is that cool?

198
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:02,613
噢～可以 咖啡，酷！
Yeah, okay. Coffee, yeah.

199
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,361
－对，我应该来点儿～
－好的，伙计
- I could go for a coffee.
- Okay, man.

200
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:08,571
来吧，就是。喝点儿吧
Come on, have some coffee.

201
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:12,566
好的来，那就喝吧
Okay, coffee it is.

202
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:34,255
这是你的烟吗？
Are those your cigarettes?

203
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,297
不是，我来的时候就有了
No, they were just sitting here
when I got here.

204
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,627
－你不抽烟，是吗？
－不抽，我戒了
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No. I gave it up.

205
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:42,486
－我也不抽
－我实在抽够了
- Not for me, either.
- Boy, enough of that.

206
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:44,657
25年！够多了！
That was enough, 25 big ones.

207
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,437
－结束了！
－原地满血复活
- Finished.
- Got the energy now.

208
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:53,652
戒了之后，我的意思...完全...
Since I quit, I mean, just everything...

209
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:55,826
更能集中注意力...
Yeah, you're focused.

210
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:58,612
－一切都如鱼得水...你明白？
－我也是
- Zeroed in. Bang, you know?
- Me, too.

211
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:03,446
我对还在抽烟的二货们感到难过，你明白？
I feel sorry for suckers still puffing away,
you know?

212
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,286
－完全没意志力！
－完全没意志力！叼奶嘴儿！
- No willpower.
- No willpower. Pacifier.

213
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:08,240
真二
Silly.

214
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:14,417
你知道，戒烟的魅力是只有在戒了之后...偶尔...
You know, the beauty of quitting is,
now that I've quit...

215
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:18,769
回味一根儿，因为！我戒了！
I can have one. Because I've quit.

216
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:23,726
我的意思这感觉就像天珍一样，不可多得
I mean, it's just like jewelry.

217
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,310
你知道，这不是真的...我不会吸进去
You know, it's not really...
I don't even inhale.

218
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,659
你想加入吗？回味一根儿？
You want to join me in one?

219
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,733
对，因为我也戒了！为什么不？
Yeah, since I quit. Okay.

220
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:37,455
－现在你戒了，可以来一根儿！
－当然～对！
- Now that you've quit, you can have one.
- Sure, yeah.

221
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:39,466
我可以回味它！没问题！
I can do that. All right.

222
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:49,422
这太棒了，伙计！
Boy, thank you.

223
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:53,288
对，你明白我的意思！
因为我们现在不是烟民！
Yeah, you know what I mean?
Now that we've quit...

224
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,221
香烟和咖啡，伙计！你懂的，非常棒的组合！
Cigarettes and coffee, man.
That's a combination.

225
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:04,647
无法抗拒！
Can't beat it.

226
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:11,592
不用多说你就知道，我们现在处在咖啡和香烟的时代
We're really the coffee-and-cigarettes
generation, when you think about it.

227
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:16,908
你明白我的意思吗？在40年代的时候是派和咖啡当道
You know what I mean? In the '40s,
it was the pie-and-coffee generation.

228
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:21,611
像在电视上的两傻亚波特和卡斯特罗，他们总是需要派和咖啡！
Like Abbott and Costello on TV, man.
They always wanted pie and coffee.

229
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:26,215
对，就像亚波特和卡斯特罗，他们一直都在点派和咖啡
Yeah, like Abbott and Costello.
They were always ordering pie and coffee.

230
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:28,360
“来点儿咖啡吧！来点儿派和咖啡吧！”
"Have some coffee.
Have some pie and coffee."

231
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,569
“你在等什么？”
"What are you waiting for?"

232
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:38,352
你经常来这儿吗？
You hang out here a lot?

233
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,626
这是我的据点儿
This is my hangout.

234
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,617
我在想，因为没看到关于你的作品在点唱机
I just wondered, 'cause I didn't see
anything of yours on the jukebox.

235
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:58,374
如果不喜欢这里，我们可以去塔可钟之类的
If you don't like it here, we could
go down to Taco Bell or something.

236
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,486
也许那里更适合你的风格
Maybe that's more your style.

237
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:06,408
你要闹哪样？我像塔可钟内款型儿的？
What are you saying, man?
You're saying I'm a Taco Bell kind of guy?

238
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,731
不，我只是说，如果你不喜欢这里...
No. I mean, if you don't like it here.

239
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:13,193
－是你说的，你不喜欢这里
－我没说
- You said you don't like it here.
- No, I didn't say that.

240
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:15,464
我们可以去国际烤薄饼之家
We could go to
the International House of Pancakes.

241
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,507
可能那儿能好一些，我不清楚
Maybe that's more up your alley.
I don't know.

242
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:21,410
我没说要走，我不想去什么国际烤薄饼之家（IHOP）
I didn't say that. I don't wanna go
to the International House of Pancakes.

243
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,010
我在这里很舒服
I'm comfortable.

244
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,049
但是那儿的咖啡更香
Coffee is good, though, at IHOP.

245
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,741
你喜欢那儿的咖啡？
You like the coffee down there at IHOP?

246
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:44,713
我喝IHOP的咖啡，我喜欢他们的咖啡，你不喜欢吗？
I drink the coffee at IHOP.
I like the coffee. You don't like it?

247
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,161
当然，我喜欢他们的咖啡！
Yeah, man. I like the IHOP coffee.

248
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:51,489
－品质上乘
－对，那儿的咖啡很不错
- Classy brew.
- Yeah, that's good coffee.

249
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:56,673
对，品质上乘的咖啡在IHOP
Yeah, that's good coffee at the IHOP.

250
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:06,409
差点儿忘了，听好！
I almost forgot. Listen.

251
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:09,761
我昨天在洛杉矶工作的时候认识了一个鼓手
I worked with this drummer
the other day in LA.

252
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,964
嘿，这哥们儿，名儿叫机械巨人
And this guy, man, his name is Giant Robo.

253
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:17,765
他的敲击真他妈给力！！
我一定要告诉你！
He was clanging and banging really hard.
Man, I thought of you.

254
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:18,944
可能你需要...
Maybe you want to...

255
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:22,245
这哥们儿～你一定要认识认识！
This is somebody,
I think you ought to check him out.

256
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,785
你的意思是...你认为我需要一个专业鼓手？
You mean,
you think I need a professional drummer?

257
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,770
我这样不行？
I'm not good enough?

258
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:31,494
你到底想说什么？
What are you talking about?

259
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:34,939
不，不，但是，我只是想...
你知道，他是一个音乐家。
No, but I'm just...
You know, it's a musician.

260
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:39,007
我想...我只是想将他介绍给你，这将非常棒。伙计
I thought... I just wanted to tell you
about this guy. It'd be great, man.

261
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,617
他超级给力的，当他在打的时侯...我就感觉“哇噢～”
It's hard and industrial, and he's beating,
and I just thought, "Wow."

262
00:19:47,846 --> 00:19:50,879
你在试图向我表达什么？
我需要一个鼓手？？？
What are you trying to tell me?
I need a drummer?

263
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:53,474
我可以招一个鼓手？
I could use a drummer?

264
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:57,697
我的现任很垃圾？
你在说什么乱七八糟的？
The drumming on my records sucks?
What are you saying?

265
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,305
算了吧！伙计
Forget it, man.

266
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:37,312
你知道吗？
You know what?

267
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,729
－我想我真的该走了
－你该走了？
- I think I really got to get going.
- You got to go?

268
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,972
或许在来一杯？或许在来根儿烟？
Maybe another cup?
Maybe another cigarette...

269
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,602
我要...但...
Boy, I'd like to.

270
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:48,863
不，我真的该走了...我的意思是...
No. I really gotta go. I mean...

271
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:54,651
我老婆，她一个人在旅店
My wife, she's alone in a motel.

272
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:58,199
或许我们可以给她打电话，让她过来这里
Maybe we could call her up,
come on down here.

273
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:01,239
喝杯咖啡，来几根儿烟
Have a cup of coffee
and a couple of cigarettes.

274
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,590
她不抽烟，你知道，这关于意志力...
She doesn't smoke.
You know, it's the willpower.

275
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,518
－我懂了
－我不想她因为我开始
- I see.
- I don't want to start her.

276
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,883
对，不要开始
No, you don't want to get her started.

277
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,989
－这是我们的小秘密
－对，同意
- This is our little thing here.
- Yeah, right.

278
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:15,963
但我们可以...
But we can just sort of...

279
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,165
我们可以让这感觉继续...你知道...
We can just keep zipping along, you know.

280
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,117
我会念记着你的
I'll be thinking of you.

281
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,573
－我必须走
－我想是的
- Gotta go.
- I guess so.

282
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:28,603
－希望很快再见到你
－啊～好的
- See you soon.
- Yeah, okay.

283
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,438
我想再多待一会儿
I wish you could stay a little longer.

284
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:37,619
－我们才刚刚开始...
－我一定得走
- We were just starting to get going here.
- Gotta go.

285
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:43,129
好，吉姆
Okay, Jim.

286
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,427
－下次见
－好，下次！
- Next time.
- Okay, next time.

287
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:48,091
－你保重
－你也是
- You take care.
- You take care, too.

288
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,753
他也不在这里
He's not on here, either.

289
00:23:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
这玩意儿会要了你的命

289
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:14,541
－你就是个他妈的大傻逼，你知道这点吗？
－咋的？
- You're a fucking moron, you know that?
- Now what?

290
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:18,417
真不敢相信，你还他妈再抽！
I can't believe that
you're still smoking those fucking things.

291
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:20,491
维尼，它快搞死你了
Vinny, they'll fuck you up.

292
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:22,864
绝对要了你的小命儿，相信我！
They'll kill you. Believe me.

293
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,128
你丫活着就是为了搞我吗？
Were you put on this fucking earth
to annoy me?

294
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,018
你说你要戒了
You said you were gonna quit.

295
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:30,473
反而，花了更多钱...
Instead, you spend a fortune...

296
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:33,679
去他妈赞助烟草公司...
so those big tobacco companies
can get fucking rich.

297
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,308
然后再得了癌症...
And then you get cancer.

298
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,274
接着再花更多的银子，赞助他妈的医疗事业
And then the fucking doctors
and the hospitals, they can get rich.

299
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:41,202
最后你的老底儿搭在火葬场！
And the undertakers, too.

300
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,471
这都是因为你一直像个大傻逼一样要抽烟！
All because you want to smoke
like a fucking moron.

301
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:46,288
我没招儿，烟瘾太他妈大，好么～亲！！
I can't help it. I'm fucking addicted, okay?

302
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,520
那，咖啡和烟...
So, coffee and cigarettes?

303
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:52,174
就是你的午餐？您觉得这特别健康，是么？
That's your lunch? That ain't healthy, is it?

304
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:54,795
你不也喝着呢么，别整的好像我他妈蛋都碎了一样！！！
You're drinking coffee,
so don't break my fucking balls.

305
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,354
维尼，我已经吃了午饭！
Vinny, I had lunch already.

306
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,593
那我减肥呢行不行！老天爷啊！！
So I'm on a diet, okay? Jesus!

307
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,175
我家内小兔崽子又来了！！！
Here comes my freaking kid.

308
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:18,224
拜托，别告诉你妈，成吗？
Do me a favor.
Don't tell your mother, please.

309
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:22,215
我他妈说什么呢？反正，她抽的跟个蒸汽火车一样！
What the fuck am I talking about?
She smokes like a locomotive, anyway.

310
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:24,653
嗨～怎么样？小家伙
How you doing, Junior?

311
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,843
－这孩子挺内向，是吗？
－最近有点儿...
- He don't talk much, does he?
- Not lately.

312
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,533
最近他有点儿不爱说话
Lately he's been the silent type.

313
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:36,078
昨晚不给你十块钱了吗？怎么这么能花？
I gave you $10 last night.
So what did you do with it?

314
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:45,993
不给你五块了吗？
I just gave you $5.

315
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,553
听着，这是最后一块！
Listen, I'll give you $1 more. That's it.

316
00:24:53,774 --> 00:24:57,156
至少抱抱吧？给你六块不抱一下是不是有点说不过去？
Can I at least get a hug?
For $6, can I get a freaking hug?

317
00:24:57,774 --> 00:24:59,180
十块才能抱？？？
$10 for a hug?

318
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:03,366
小兔崽子你是不是脑袋让门挤坏了？
好吧，过来！我给你...
You gotta be out of your freaking mind.
All right, come here. I'll give you.

319
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:08,356
去吧小崽子，别买那些垃圾，吃点好的！～
You better go get yourself something to eat,
and something good.

320
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:11,941
对！～～～跟他似的！！！
买点咖啡和烟啥的...
Yeah, just like him.
Get some coffee and cigarettes.

321
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,598
噢～～～老兄！！！
你他妈说什么乱七八糟的呢？
Oh, brother!
What the fuck are you talking about?

322
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,358
你看看你自己喝了多少！！！
Look how much coffee you're drinking.

323
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,566
一壶都快喝见底儿了！！！
You got the whole fucking pot
over there with you.

324
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:21,319
那怎么了？我来了老规矩就是一壶！！！
So what? They always bring me a whole pot.

325
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:23,817
我喜欢咖啡，让我精力充沛～
I like coffee. Keeps me going.

326
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:28,034
那让你精力充沛是么？
你个老混球，咖啡因疯子！
It keeps you going, all right.
You're a fucking maniac. A caffeine maniac.

327
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:30,026
－你是不是也喝咖啡？
－是啊！
- You're drinking coffee, ain't you?
- Yeah.

328
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:32,578
－那？
－或许你也应该戒了！
- So?
- So maybe you should try to quit.

329
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:45,000
－我不是他妈虎头蛇尾的人！（双关语：quit=戒断 quitter=虎头蛇尾的人）
－行！你牛逼！干杯！     （喝咖啡就应该持之以恒戒，戒掉就是虎头蛇尾）
- I ain't no fucking quitter.
- I'll drink to that.

330
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,709
大脑穿刺的傻逼
Fucking moron.

331
00:25:48,265 --> 00:25:50,403
尼玛，小兔崽子又来了！
Shit, here comes my kid again.

332
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:56,103
又花了多少？
How much did you spend?

333
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:59,329
四块就买了这玩意儿？
And that's all you got for $4?

334
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:02,502
豌豆和饮料要四块？
Peas and something to drink for $4?

335
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:06,175
－这是袋什么玩意儿？
－这是中国豌豆
- What the heck is in that bag?
- It's those Chinese peas.

336
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:08,709
不是吗？
They're not?

337
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,976
是日本的...？
They're Japanese?

338
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:13,185
中国的日本的，不都一样
Chinese, Japanese. Same thing.

339
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:17,792
得一个
Try one.

340
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:30,878
诶呀～我的老天爷啊！尝起来像黑胡椒。
Jesus Christ! Tastes like black pepper.

341
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:32,548
拿来！
Give me those.

342
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:37,598
你个小逼崽子，你看见了吗？
他想药死我！！！
Little bastard. Did you see that?
He tried to fucking poison me.

343
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:41,498
才没，乔伊！听我的，那是高级货
No, he didn't, Joe. Listen to me.
Those things are very expensive.

344
00:26:41,573 --> 00:26:44,256
那可是地方特色美食，一般人不能消受高雅的品味。
They're like a delicacy. A refined taste.

345
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,305
嗯～就像我的菊花一样高雅。
Refined taste, my ass.

346
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,420
老天爷啊！！又来？！
Jesus Christ, not again.

347
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:56,636
我他妈还没完整的点上一根烟，就跟犯了死罪一样么？
I can't even light a fucking cigarette
around here without getting busted.

348
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:59,358
你要知道一点，你的行为绝逼像个宇宙大傻逼！
You know something?
You really are a fucking moron.

349
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,434
我一定会去烟草公司写感谢信...
I'm gonna get to those
big tobacco companies...

350
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,336
当火葬场准备炼你的时候...
and I'm gonna thank them
when they put you in the fucking ground.

351
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:09,565
我有没有告诉你？你像一个让我踹了的怨妇
And did I ever tell that you're like
a fucking wife that I don't need?

352
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:14,047
再也不能他妈的享受香烟了
Can't fucking enjoy a cigarette.

00:27:26,000  --> 00:27:29,000
瑞蕾

353
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:27,859
打扰一下，小姐
我能再给你一些咖啡吗？
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get you some more coffee?

354
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:32,595
我真希望你没这么做...
I really wish you hadn't done that.

355
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:36,628
刚才的色泽和温度都是我正喜欢的
I had it the right color,
the right temperature. It was just right.

356
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:41,235
抱歉...
Sorry.

357
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:26,732
嗨～
Hi.

358
00:29:30,456 --> 00:29:33,423
抱歉关于刚才的...
Sorry. Sorry about the coffee.

359
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:24,136
－你的名字是歌莉娅？
－不
- Does your name happen to be Gloria?
- No.

360
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,456
因为...我觉得...你跟...是不是朋友？
'Cause I thought maybe you...
You're not friends with...

361
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:34,058
对不起
Sorry.

362
00:31:07,856 --> 00:31:10,092
那要不要我再给你来点儿其他的？
So can I get you something else?

363
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:13,611
比如三明治什么的...搭配咖啡的...
A sandwich? Something to eat
along with your coffee?

364
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:18,635
只有咖啡和烟不是健康的午餐
It's not a very healthy lunch,
just the coffee and cigarettes.

365
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:20,718
这不是我午餐好吗？
It's not my lunch, okay?

366
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,542
对不起
Sorry.

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,076
没问题

367
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:26,076
艾里克斯
Alex.

368
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:28,731
吓我一跳
You startled me.

369
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:31,967
近来怎么样？伊扎克
How are you, Isaach?

370
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:33,692
好？
Okay?

371
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,625
非常好
Very well.

372
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,471
我很高兴见到你
I'm happy to see you.

373
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:44,767
我已经受够了巴黎，你不能想象...
I was so sick of being in Paris.
You can't imagine.

374
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,702
坐吧
Sit down.

375
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,534
所以，我很开心你给我打电话
So, I was happy to get your call.

376
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:00,986
我们已经很久没在一起聚聚了
So long time we didn't see each other.

377
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:07,129
－我点了咖啡给你，要么？
－当然，谢谢
- I ordered you some coffee, okay?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

378
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,944
那一切可好？
So, everything is okay?

379
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:15,776
都还行，不错
Everything is okay. Very good.

380
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:18,203
我挺好的
I am fine.

381
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:05,079
那你真的都还不错？
So, are you sure that
everything is okay with you?

382
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:10,007
嗯，不错
Everything is okay.

383
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,270
你呢？
And you?

384
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:15,986
我？不错
Me? Things are okay.

385
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,410
不是很完美，你知道
但是，还说过的去
Not perfect, you know,
but pretty much okay.

386
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:23,291
很好！我非常高兴见到你
Good. I'm very happy to see you.

387
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:26,417
伙计，见到你非常开心
I'm happy to see you, man.

388
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:46,326
只是因为太久没有见过你了...
It's just that
since I didn't see you for so long...

389
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,452
你突然打电话说要见我，我还以为你出了什么事儿呢。
and you called to say you wanted to see me,
I thought maybe something was wrong.

390
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:54,482
没，我只是想要看看你，就这样
No. I just wanted to see you, that's all.

391
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,450
我也是！伙计，我也要见见你
Me, too, man. I wanted to see you, too.

392
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:12,817
你真的没什么要告诉我的吗？
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to tell me?

393
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,254
－没出什么事儿？
－但是，为什么？
- Nothing bothering you?
- But why?

394
00:36:17,463 --> 00:36:20,659
－你希望我出点儿什么事儿？
－不，不是的
- Do you want something to be wrong?
- Not at all.

395
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:25,357
但是你打电话给我，我的直觉告诉我，你是不是出什么事儿了。
When I got your call, I had an intuition
that something was bothering you.

396
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:28,813
可能有什么要告诉我的，就这样，伙计
Something maybe you need to talk about.
That's all, man.

397
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,050
伊扎克，没什么不好的。
Isaach, there is nothing wrong.

398
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:34,256
真的！
Really.

399
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:37,740
好么？
Okay?

400
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,372
真滴么？
Are you sure?

401
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:47,601
你坑爹呢？伊扎克？
Are you crazy, Isaach?

402
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:57,009
你真的木有什么事儿...
Are you sure you have nothing...

403
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:59,698
你知道，要说粗来的？
you know, to let out?

404
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:06,030
那我编点儿？
Should I invent something bad?

405
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:08,297
我可以为你编点儿...
I could invent something bad for you.

406
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:12,146
不，不是滴
才不要你编呢...
Not at all.
No. I don't want you to invent something.

407
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:14,665
你知道，我素你最好滴盆友...
You know, I'm your best friend.

408
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:17,552
你只管告诉我到底怎么回事行了
You should feel completely free
to tell me the truth.

409
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,368
和我说到底是什么困扰着你
To tell me whatever is bothering you.

410
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:22,826
快别逼逼了！
Cut the shit.

411
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:31,178
好吧，成！懂了
Okay, I understand. That's cool.

412
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:34,477
谢谢你！
Thank you.

413
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:37,453
没问题
No problem.

414
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,167
伊扎克，没问题的！
Isaach, no problem.

415
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,218
我猜，那我快走了
I guess I'm gonna go.

416
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:09,101
真假？那么快？
Really? So soon?

417
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,170
是，你知道...伙计...
Yeah, you know, man...

418
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:16,458
如果，你实在没什么可对我说的，我也不想给你出难题了...
if you don't want to talk to me about it,
I don't want to be a problem.

419
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:22,343
这没什么问题，伊扎克
你明白么？真没事儿
There is no problem, Isaach.
Don't you understand? No problem.

420
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,893
我明白！但是，听好...
I understand. But listen...

421
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,410
如果你当面儿说不出来，随时给我打电话，好吗？
if you don't want to talk now,
call me anytime, okay?

422
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:35,116
可能你觉得现在还不太是时候，这没影响...
Now maybe it's not the right time for you,
that's all.

423
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:55,426
那，我还是很开心见到你滴！
So, I was very happy to see you.

424
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:58,057
是，我也是！
Yes. Me, too.

425
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:03,239
很抱歉让你失望了...但是真的没啥事儿，真的
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but there is nothing wrong. Really.

426
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:06,404
嗯嗯，没事儿
It's okay.

427
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,352
我都能理解
I do understand.

428
00:39:09,418 --> 00:39:12,134
不，你不明白！
No. You don't understand.

429
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,130
电我啊！！！
Call me.

430
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:18,271
回见，伊扎克
See you, Isaach.

431
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,034
很快就会！
Soon.

432
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
表姐妹

432
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,888
－嗨～很高兴见到你
－我也是
- Hi, so nice to see you.
- Me too.

433
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,585
太久啦～～
It's been ages.

434
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:44,505
上次是...几年前在悉尼，对不对？
Last time, what?
A couple of years ago in Sydney, wasn't it?

435
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:46,682
真的吗？已经两年了呢？
Really, was that two years ago?

436
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:50,177
杰夫和贝瑞怎么样呀？
How are Jeff and Beryl?

437
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:55,039
你知道，老样子，老样子
仍然是一些父母奇怪的小伎俩
You know, same old, same old.
Still stuck in their odd little parental ways.

438
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:00,417
那你没和凯特先生还有孩子在这儿吗？
So you're not with Mr. Cate and the baby
on this trip?

439
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:05,082
没啦～很不巧的是我自己在这里
要下个星期才能见到呢。
No. Unfortunately, I'm by myself.
I'll see them next week.

440
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:10,516
他们都挺好的呗？
Everyone's good?

441
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:14,975
诶～～～～～～
我想要个小孩儿
Yeah, I want a baby.

442
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:17,780
也不知道啥时候呢...
At some point.

443
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:22,329
－请问需要些什么？
－你想要点啥，小凯
- What can I get for you?
- What are you having, Catie?

444
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:27,829
请问可以给我一杯意式浓缩咖啡吗？
要大一点的杯子哟～
Can I have an espresso, please?
In a large cup?

445
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:31,932
嗯！那我也来杯内个，谢了，双份儿啊！
Yeah, I'll have an espresso, too, thanks.
A double.

446
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,868
可以再给我一小杯热热的牛奶吗？
能不能加热的呢？
And can I have some hot milk on the side?
And could you heat it?

447
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:37,527
－嗯，我想可以的
－真谢谢你了呢～～
- I think we can manage that.
- Thank you.

448
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,684
真不好意思啊！来晚了
我知道你时间紧
I'm sorry I'm late.
I know you haven't got a lot of time.

449
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:50,268
啊～～没有关系的，不用担心这个
我想和你在这多坐一会呢
Don't worry about it.
I just wish I could stay here longer.

450
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:54,747
你在这儿住？还是，只在这儿做你的什么新闻什么的...？
Do you stay here overnight,
or do you just do your press stuff here?

451
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,154
你的晚宴...
Your junket.

452
00:41:58,173 --> 00:42:01,521
不，我住在这里的。也在这做采访。
No, I stay overnight.
And I do the interviews here, too.

453
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:03,122
这样更方便一些的
I just think it's easier.

454
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,465
直接就可以在我的套房里做采访。
They do the interviews in my suite upstairs.

455
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:07,866
现在他们在准备下一场采访...
They're setting up for the next interview...

456
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:12,087
所以，我觉得我们在这里见面更好一些。
and I just thought maybe it would be nicer
if we met down here.

457
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:17,238
噢算了...夏儿，你不能在这...
No, thanks, Shell. You're not...

458
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:20,659
来吧！！！～～～
Go on.

459
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:23,731
他们不会不让你抽的～
They're not going to stop you smoking.

460
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:30,899
－整吧，姐～
－哎咿～那谢谢啦～
- There you go, cous'.
- Thanks.

461
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:38,582
那他们就给你一个套房...
So you mean they give you
this full-on hotel suite...

462
00:42:38,649 --> 00:42:41,266
又工作又睡觉的？
and they also use it for your publicity?

463
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,327
真够省的啊～
Seems kind of cheap.

464
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:50,029
哇噢～～是一个套房耶～
他们可以隔开单独的房间哦～
Well, it's a suite.
So they just divide up the room.

465
00:42:50,105 --> 00:42:52,046
啊，那为啥不能单独给你一个...
Yeah, but why couldn't
they get you a suite...

466
00:42:52,121 --> 00:42:54,837
然后在弄个工作间儿？
and get another suite to do your press in?

467
00:42:55,224 --> 00:42:57,841
现在做的这个预算不是很高的。
It's pretty low-budget, this thing I did.

468
00:42:58,264 --> 00:42:59,605
对，但是...
Yeah, still.

469
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:02,799
这太便宜糊弄事儿了吧，大妹子！
It's pretty cheap, man.

470
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:07,471
请问还需要其他的吗？
Can I get you anything else?

471
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,910
－不需要了，谢谢你，这样很好
－您太客气了
- No, thanks. That's great.
- You're welcome.

472
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,766
来这真够费劲的了...差点进不来...
Kind of weird getting in here.
I almost didn't...

473
00:43:20,758 --> 00:43:23,343
直到知道我是你表妹才让进。
until they found out I was your cousin.

474
00:43:24,854 --> 00:43:28,498
在外边儿有狗仔队什么的...
There're some photographer,
paparazzi guys hanging out front.

475
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:32,266
我猜他们都为了跟着你，对吗？
I guess they kind of
follow you around, right?

476
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:36,658
噢～你知道，大概是，因为附近会有所谓的名人
You know, whatever so-called celebrities
are around, I suppose.

477
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:41,041
天呐！有时候你也真够他妈的费事儿了，对吗？
God, that must be
a real fucking drag sometimes, right?

478
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:44,718
我的意思是，不像我...
I mean, not like me.

479
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:46,702
无拘无束
I'm free.

480
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:49,260
一无所有，但是完全自由自在
Practically broke, but I'm completely free.

481
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:52,201
没人跟踪我，绝逼没人这样...
No one's stalking me,
that's for fucking sure.

482
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,692
除了他们觉得，我是你的内个时候
Except when they thought I was you.

483
00:43:56,275 --> 00:44:00,235
去高级夜店的时候他们以为我是你，才让进
I got into this club once
because they thought I was you.

484
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:04,684
后来发现了，直接撵走我...
Then they found out I wasn't
and asked me to leave.

485
00:44:04,787 --> 00:44:06,445
真他妈差劲
Pretty fucking rude.

486
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:11,723
别误会...
我的意思是，你肯定过的特别好，你啥也不缺...
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, it must be fabulous. You got it all.

487
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:13,932
你有个好老公，漂亮的孩子...
You got a good husband, beautiful baby.

488
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:16,969
环游世界，住高档酒店...
Travel all over the world,
stay in fancy hotels.

489
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:19,501
派对...
Parties...

490
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:23,504
噢～～怎么说呢“这山望着那山高”吧～
You know what they say,
"The grass is always greener."

491
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,545
那...他...
So, how's...

492
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:28,680
该死的
Shit.

493
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,214
－...强尼...怎么样？
－谁？
- Johnny.
- Who?

494
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:32,263
吉米，汤米. 对不起.
Jimmy. Tommy. Sorry.

495
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:34,861
他还好吗？
How is he?

496
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:40,013
我俩已经黄两年了。
We broke up almost two years ago.

497
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,816
噢～汤米，对，那个龟孙子
Tommy, yeah. What a dickhead.

498
00:44:45,456 --> 00:44:48,041
现在有新的男朋友，李，还记得吗？
Got a new boyfriend now. Lee. Remember?

499
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,501
他玩乐队的，写信的时候提到过他
He's in a band. Wrote you about him.

500
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,211
他在我生活中非常有份量
He's a pretty huge part of my life.

501
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:57,194
对不起，夏儿，我觉得你没有。
Sorry, Shell, I don't think you did.

502
00:44:57,263 --> 00:44:59,750
有，我还给你发了一张他妈的CD
Yeah, I even sent you his fucking CD.

503
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:03,587
你助理可能没给你。
Your assistant
probably didn't give it to you.

504
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:08,966
但是没事儿，真的没事儿
我的意思是，我知道你太忙了...
It's okay. It's totally cool.
I mean, I know how busy your life is.

505
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,779
－你还记得你发到哪里了吗？
－不
- Do you remember where you sent it?
- No.

506
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:16,067
我的意思是...你一周在洛杉矶...
I mean, one week you're in LA...

507
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,114
然后又在伦敦，然后在悉尼...
then you're in London,
then you're in Sydney.

508
00:45:18,189 --> 00:45:22,018
我的意思是，你根本就没他妈固定的城市
一天一个地儿
I mean, you're in a different fucking city
every day of the week.

509
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:37,992
我真的想听一听那个音乐，是什么类型的呢？
I'd love to hear the music.
What does it sound like?

510
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:41,129
内个是很...
It's really...

511
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:44,223
很躁...
kind of hard...

512
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:47,494
很给力...差不多是这类型... 
and it's industrial, kind of throbbing...

513
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:52,865
我觉得你不了解这种
I don't think you'd get it.

514
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:58,756
－那他们叫什么呢？
－他们叫Sqürl
- What are they called?
- They're called Sqürl.

515
00:45:59,498 --> 00:46:00,708
松鼠？ （松鼠＝Squirrel）
Squirrel?

516
00:46:00,874 --> 00:46:03,557
不，是Sqürl，你知道，都那么叫...
No, Sqürl. You know, like they say it here.

517
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,658
是S-Q-Ü-R-L, Sqürl
S-Q-U-R-L, with an umlaut
over the "U" Sqürl.

518
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,336
啊～～～Sqürl，对对对
Sqürl. I get it. Right.

519
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:14,206
那找到你给我的那个CD之前，可以先买一张听吗？
So can I buy the CD
until I find the one you sent?

520
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:18,916
不，还不行，他们是用一个独立厂牌做的，你知道，所以...
No. Not yet. They recorded it independently,
you know, so...

521
00:46:19,336 --> 00:46:22,631
但是我觉得公司终于要出版了
But I think the record company's
gonna put it out finally.

522
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,873
我觉得。
I think.

523
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:31,844
我真应该找找那张CD，听一下。
I'm gonna have to find that CD
so I can listen to it.

524
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:34,812
你找不着的
You're not gonna find it.

525
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:37,569
夏儿，其实，这不公平
Shell, that isn't fair, actually.

526
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,955
－真的，你真找不着！
－真的吗？
- It's true. You're not gonna find it.
- Really?

527
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:46,587
我他妈绝对清楚，因为我刚才想起来了...
I fucking know you're not.
'Cause I just remembered...

528
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:49,825
我根本没有发给你。
I didn't actually send it to you.

529
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:52,828
我觉得，那时侯，想发给你来着。
I think I just thought
about sending it to you.

530
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,579
噢～差点忘了，这是给你的
Almost forgot. This is for you.

531
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,683
谢谢，这是什么？
Thanks. What is it?

532
00:47:17,732 --> 00:47:21,114
这东西很贵的，要好几百块钱呢。
This is really expensive stuff.
It must have cost hundreds.

533
00:47:25,347 --> 00:47:28,063
酷，谢谢，这个我用得上
Cool, thanks. I could use this stuff.

534
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:31,963
让我像一个大腕儿，对吗
Make me look like a movie star, right?

535
00:47:35,362 --> 00:47:37,303
－干杯
－干杯，斑斓的小妞
- Cheers.
- Cheers, gorgeous.

536
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,426
真心的，小凯，谢谢你见我
Seriously, Catie, thanks for seeing me.

537
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:50,144
不，应该谢谢你见我才对。
No, thanks for seeing me.

538
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:55,196
也谢谢你送我昂贵的二手闲置见面礼
And thanks for all the fancy swag.

539
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:58,270
这不算什么的
It's nothing.

540
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:02,235
这是闲置对吗？
It is swag, isn't it?

541
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,548
他们肯定送你很多这种东西：
They probably give you
all kinds of free stuff:

542
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:08,282
珠宝，服饰...
Jewelry, clothes.

543
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,065
有可能还送你汽车，对吗？
Probably give you cars, right?

544
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:13,944
没，还真没人送车。
No, they don't give me cars.

545
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:17,626
有时候他们会送我一些化妆品什么的...
They sometimes give me makeup,
from time to time.

546
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:19,734
但是，我只是觉得...
But I just thought...

547
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:22,141
我不知道怎么说...我只是想...
I don't know, I just wanted...

548
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,475
我没有时间去购物
Didn't have time to go shopping.

549
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:28,061
噢噢～没事！这很好
我的意思是，这很不错，我能用...
No, really, it's fine.
I mean, it's great. I can use it.

550
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:30,937
只是，你不认为这有点儿可笑吗？
It's just funny, don't you think?

551
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:35,379
你负担不起的东西，对你来说还要花钱是非常渴望不可及
When you can't afford something,
it's really expensive.

552
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,234
但是，你要是负担得起，你都不用自掏腰包，相当于免费！
And then when you can afford it, it's free.

553
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:42,713
有点颠倒了，你不觉得吗？
Kind of backward, don't you think?

554
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:48,156
这个世界是有点倾斜的，我猜，在哪儿都是...
The world's a bit like that, I guess,
in a lot of ways.

555
00:48:49,564 --> 00:48:51,451
关于狗仔队...
Speaking of paparazzi...

556
00:48:51,612 --> 00:48:54,426
昨天，我在小报儿上看到你的照片儿
I saw these photos of you the other day
in the tabloids.

557
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:56,727
啊～不要说那个了，咿呀～～～
Don't tell me that. Yuck.

558
00:48:57,787 --> 00:48:59,445
我穿的什么衣服？
What was I wearing?

559
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:01,010
对不起.
Sorry.

560
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:05,525
喂～嗨～琳兹
Hello? Hi, Lindsey.

561
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:11,571
我和我表妹小夏在楼下的咖啡厅
I'm downstairs, in the coffee room
with my cousin Shelly.

562
00:49:12,634 --> 00:49:14,160
已经要...
It's already...

563
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,377
好吧，好，我这就上去，拜～
Okay, yeah. I'll be up in a minute. Bye.

564
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:21,041
－你要回去上班儿？
－对啊
- Got to get back to work?
- Yeah.

565
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:22,705
继续那份苦差事？
Back to the grind?

566
00:49:25,146 --> 00:49:26,607
你想和我一起上去吗？
Do you want to come up to the room?

567
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,812
不是很有意思，但是欢迎你上去
It won't be very interesting,
but you're welcome to come up.

568
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:32,782
啥？看你做电视采访？？？
What, and watch you do TV interviews
and stuff?

569
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:35,056
娱乐今宵这种？
Like Entertainment Tonight?

570
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:48,053
也许，你可以给我那张CD或者给我写信之类的...
Maybe you can send me that CD,
or a letter, or something.

571
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:52,558
－对，但是，发给你你也看不到
－噢行了，你要是真的发给我我一定会看
- Yeah, but you wouldn't read it.
- Stop it. I would if you actually sent it.

572
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:58,255
我得要走了，对不起了呢
I've really gotta go. Sorry.

573
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,353
很高兴见到你，你有我的电话号码吗？
It was great seeing you.
Have you got my numbers?

574
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:10,030
保重了～给大家带好～
Take care. Send my love to everyone.

575
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:15,985
好，你也帮我带好
Yeah, send my love to everyone
on your end.

576
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:22,474
...如果他们记得我
If they even remember me.

577
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:24,588
－拜～小凯
－回见了，夏儿
- Bye, Catie.
- See you, Shell.

578
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:28,651
这些算在我房间，如果她还要其他的也是。
Put that on my room
and anything else she wants.

579
00:50:28,757 --> 00:50:31,604
－希望下次我可以见到鲁
－啊对
- Maybe next time I'll get to meet Lou.
- Yeah.

580
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:34,126
是李！
It's Lee.

581
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:43,312
诶～服务员儿～
Excuse me.

582
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:48,296
能不能给我来个特基拉，谢了，双份儿的，还要菜单
Can I have a tequila?
Thanks, a double, and the menu.

583
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:51,184
不好意思小姐，大厅不可以吸烟。
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in the lounge.

584
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
杰克为梅格展示他的特斯拉线圈

584
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,773
那，杰克你想要和我说关于你的特斯拉线圈吗？
So, Jack, you going to tell me
about your tesla coil?

585
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:43,879
你说过你不想听
You said you didn't want to hear about it.

586
00:52:43,946 --> 00:52:46,531
对，但那是我之前说的
Yeah, but that was a while ago.

587
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:50,659
我不知道，如果我想要告诉你关于这个...
I don't know if I want to talk about it.

588
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:54,597
来吧，杰克
Come on, Jack.

589
00:52:54,665 --> 00:52:57,599
你那么麻烦用你的小红手推车拖到这里...
You dragged it all the way down here
in your little red wagon.

590
00:52:57,673 --> 00:52:59,876
说吧...告诉我吧...
Come on, just tell me about it.

591
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,902
我做的这个是用尼古拉·特斯拉的原始设计
I built it based on the inventor
Nikola Tesla's original designs.

592
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,887
是一个空气变压器...
It's an air transformer...

593
00:53:11,111 --> 00:53:14,688
由主线圈和副线圈调整共振
with primary and secondary coils
that are tuned to resonate.

594
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:18,052
主要就是一个升压变压器
It's basically a step-up transformer...

595
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,373
它可以把相对低压高强电流转换为高压弱电流...
which converts relatively low-voltage
high current to high-voltage low current...

596
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:24,129
用高频的
at high frequencies.

597
00:53:25,894 --> 00:53:27,322
你还记得吗？...
Do you remember...

598
00:53:27,399 --> 00:53:31,075
我们还是小孩子的时候
你有一个小芭比娃娃的镜子
when we were kids,
you had a little Barbie makeup mirror?

599
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:33,441
嗯，我记得那个
Yeah, I remember that.

600
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:36,316
那个镜子有一个小荧光
It had a little fluorescent light on it?

601
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:39,774
是尼古拉·特斯拉发明了荧光
Nikola Tesla invented fluorescent light.

602
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:43,298
如果没有他，我们没有交流电...
Without him,
we wouldn't have alternating current...

603
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:46,812
没有收音机，电视，X光技术...
radio, television, x-ray technology...

604
00:53:47,813 --> 00:53:51,358
没有感应电机，粒子束流，激光
induction motors, particle beams, lasers.

605
00:53:51,556 --> 00:53:54,687
如果没有他，这些什么都没有。
None of that would even exist,
if it weren't for him.

606
00:53:54,756 --> 00:53:56,610
或者，也没有特斯拉乐队～
Or the rock band, Tesla.

607
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:00,828
搞笑！！
Funny.

608
00:54:03,075 --> 00:54:04,962
特斯拉绝对是一个天才
Tesla was a true genius.

609
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:10,045
如果我们更多关注他的创意，这世界一定会变得更加美好。
If we had paid more attention to his ideas,
the world would be a much better place.

610
00:54:10,115 --> 00:54:13,213
我们人人都能享用免费的通讯技术，免费的的交通运输...
We'd have free mass communication,
free transportation...

611
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:14,875
人人都有取之不尽用之不完的能源。
free energy for everyone.

612
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:19,556
就是因为他想造福人类使用免费能源，使得那些人排挤他诽谤他...令他无法继续...
That's why they discredited him in the end.
For free energy.

613
00:54:20,546 --> 00:54:24,222
他能感知到，地球是一个声音共振的导体。
He perceived the Earth
as a conductor of acoustical resonance.

614
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:30,045
多美好的想法啊
What a beautiful idea.

615
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:37,149
那，杰克，你要给我看看它工作起来什么样吗？
So, Jack, are you going to show me
how the coil works?

616
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,926
好，没问题
Yeah, all right.

617
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:44,568
你得带上这个
You'll need these.

618
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,131
－好了，你准备好了吗？梅格
－我准备好了
- All right, you ready, Meg?
- I'm ready.

619
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:46,069
该死的，出故障了
Damn it. Something went wrong.

620
00:55:47,419 --> 00:55:49,109
没事，照样牛逼
It was cool, though.

621
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:53,272
对，但是不应该停啊
它应该继续运转的啊
Yeah, but it wasn't supposed to stop.
It was supposed to keep working.

622
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,226
我不知道出什么问题了
I don't know what happened.

623
00:55:55,323 --> 00:55:57,689
我觉得，也许是你的电容器冒烟儿了
I think maybe you blew a capacitor?

624
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:00,399
没有，我的电容器没冒烟儿，梅格
No, I didn't blow a capacitor, Meg.

625
00:56:03,258 --> 00:56:05,145
也许应该断掉你的GFI（插座）
Maybe it tripped your GFI.

626
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:08,023
对，你的接地漏电保护插座！
Yeah, your Ground Fault Interrupter.

627
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:11,384
嘿！我知道什么是插座
不是那个的问题
Yeah, I know what a GFI is.
That's not what happened.

628
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,357
你用不着这么激动突然打断我...
You don't have to snap at me.

629
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:35,646
我觉得，也许是你的火花间隙太大
导致它在火花线圈振动的时候出了问题
I think maybe the spark gaps
are too far apart on your spark coil vibrator.

630
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:44,469
对，有可能
Yeah, that could be it.

631
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:47,120
我猜
I guess.

632
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:52,564
对对，就是，就是那儿的问题
Yeah, it is. That's it.

633
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:56,817
你是对的，我没检查那里
You're right about that.
I didn't check that earlier.

634
00:57:09,364 --> 00:57:11,752
那我现在回家检查一下去
I'm gonna go home and check it out.

635
00:57:13,524 --> 00:57:16,273
－你明天去不去打保龄球？
－嗯，我会过去
- Are you going to go bowling tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'll be there.

636
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,379
那好，我们在那见
All right, I'll see you there.

637
00:58:04,209 --> 00:58:07,023
地球是一个声音共振的导体！
Earth as a conductor
of acoustical resonance.

638
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,020
表亲？

638
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:31,020
喂，是谁？
Hello, who is this?

639
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:34,697
劳拉，嗨～我是阿尔弗雷德·莫里纳，找史蒂夫·库根
Laura. Hi, this is Alfred Molina
for Steve Coogan.

640
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:41,155
M-O-L-I-N-A.

641
00:58:43,405 --> 00:58:44,866
艺人，对
The actor, yes.

642
00:58:46,669 --> 00:58:49,254
我想再次确认一下史蒂夫是不是...
I was just double-checking that Steve...

643
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,720
他是，非常好
He is. Great, okay.

644
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:54,436
以防万一，我的手机号码是... ...
Just in case you need it,
my cell phone number...

645
00:58:54,508 --> 00:58:55,620
喂？
Hello?

646
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:08,002
－你好，阿尔弗雷的
－史蒂夫，你好！
- Hello, Alfred.
- Steve, hello.

647
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:12,104
嗨，我很高兴你能来
请坐吧
Hi. I'm so glad you could make it.
Please sit down.

648
00:59:12,747 --> 00:59:16,837
我刚才还给你的助理劳拉打电话，问一下你是不是在路上
I was just talking to Laura, your assistant,
seeing if you were on your way here.

649
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,368
－我来了
－棒极了！
- I'm here.
- Fantastic.

650
00:59:18,442 --> 00:59:21,059
恕我冒昧的点了茶给你
I took the liberty of ordering some tea.

651
00:59:21,706 --> 00:59:23,167
要我给你倒上吗？
Shall I be mother?

652
00:59:23,722 --> 00:59:26,110
噢，没关系。我可以自己来
That's okay, I'll be my own mother.

653
00:59:26,473 --> 00:59:28,360
这有为你点的牛奶
Some milk there for you.

654
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:30,723
正宗的茶！
Real tea.

655
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:33,571
很难寻的
It's hard to come by.

656
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:38,113
我曾幻想如果我能赢得金球奖或者奥斯卡小金人...
I have this fantasy where if I ever won
a Golden Globe or an Academy Award...

657
00:59:38,217 --> 00:59:42,526
那我一定利用好这个机会，教美国佬怎么做一杯像样的茶
I'd use the opportunity to tell the Yanks
how to make a decent cup of tea.

658
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,399
－为了这杯正宗的茶！
－干杯！
- Here's to a good cup of tea.
- Cheers.

659
00:59:51,112 --> 00:59:53,446
我喜欢你的大衣
I love your coat.

660
00:59:54,311 --> 00:59:56,198
对啊，这可是维维安·韦斯特伍德
Yeah, it's Viv Westwood.

661
00:59:58,919 --> 01:00:01,471
我特别喜欢英国的设计师
I've got a weakness for British designers.

662
01:00:01,543 --> 01:00:03,746
我不知道美国的设计师是...
I don't know what it is
about American designers.

663
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:06,018
他们太保守了
They're just too safe.

664
01:00:07,302 --> 01:00:11,076
那你穿这样不热吗？外面将近29摄氏度呢
Aren't you going to be a little bit warm?
It's about 85 outside.

665
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:14,404
啊不不不，我出门就脱了...
No, I take it off when I go out.

666
01:00:15,173 --> 01:00:17,376
在这，只是因为空调的原因
It's just the air conditioning.

667
01:00:24,325 --> 01:00:28,797
－那你在洛杉矶多久了？
－我们在这大概有7年了
- So how long have you been living in LA?
- We've been here about seven years.

668
01:00:29,285 --> 01:00:30,845
我们爱死这儿了
We love it here.

669
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,206
旅游参观的话不错
I do love visiting LA.

670
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:38,716
但我一直在说，洛杉矶虽好，但此地不易久留
But I always say, it's a great place to visit,
it's an even nicer place to leave.

671
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,145
那些棕榈树...
The palm trees...

672
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:44,856
那些棕榈树真他妈碍眼...
Palm trees annoy the fuck out of me.

673
01:00:45,668 --> 01:00:48,515
嗯嗯，不是所有人都像我一样喜欢这里
It's not for everybody. I like it here.

674
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:51,612
本来是因为工作上的事儿才来这里的
I came out here for the work and stuff.

675
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:57,307
我终于可以见到你咧！
It's great to finally meet you.

676
01:00:57,539 --> 01:01:00,473
我应该告诉你，其实我是你的超级粉丝儿...
I've got to say I'm a huge fan of your stuff...

677
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:02,847
看过你所有的电视还有喜剧片什么的...
all the stuff you've done on TV,
the comedy stuff.

678
01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:07,615
我有你所有的录像带，都是从老家发过来的，实在是太棒了！
I've got all the tapes.
I get them sent over. It's fantastic.

679
01:01:08,258 --> 01:01:09,435
谢谢你的支持
Thank you.

680
01:01:15,553 --> 01:01:19,382
我也听说过你很多...
Likewise, I'm certainly very aware of you.

681
01:01:19,649 --> 01:01:20,859
哇噢～
Great.

682
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:25,881
我看过你演的电视剧
I saw that TV series you did.

683
01:01:27,072 --> 01:01:28,566
啊～你看过？
Yeah, you saw that?

684
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:30,838
对，很有意思
Yeah. Interesting.

685
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:34,871
－但是已经取消播放了...
－对，我听说了
- We got canceled.
- Yeah, I heard that.

686
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,524
喜剧表演是非常难以拿捏的...
Comedy's such a difficult thing.

687
01:01:44,223 --> 01:01:48,794
你的职业前景一片光明，如日中天，你现在是炙手可热的大明星。
Your career seems to be going terribly well.
You've got a lot of heat at the moment.

688
01:01:51,422 --> 01:01:53,080
你是因为这个在这吗？
Is that why you're here?

689
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:57,372
在这有很多的宣传和见面会，这很好
The merry-go-round of meetings. It's nice.

690
01:01:57,438 --> 01:02:01,845
终于引起人们的关注了，这是好的开端
People are finally starting
to take a bit of notice, which is great.

691
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,535
－你的见面会有意思吗？
－当然
- Are you meeting on anything interesting?
- Yeah.

692
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:17,687
我必须让你知道，你太出色了...
I've got to say you were just fantastic...

693
01:02:17,885 --> 01:02:22,488
在《24小时》当中，毫无疑问...
《24小时狂欢派对》给人非常非常深刻的印象
in 24 Hour. No, seriously,
24 Hour Party People was just a knockout.

694
01:02:22,556 --> 01:02:25,337
－我的意思是，杰出的，巨作！
－谢谢
- I mean, brilliant. Great work.
- Thank you.

695
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,049
真的是非常杰出的。是...
Really brilliant. It was...

696
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,092
而且影评...
And the reviews...

697
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:33,783
太尼玛好了！！！！
They were pretty fucking great.

698
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:36,468
都给我震了！因为，是...
I was amazed because it was...

699
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:39,985
我不觉得很多人参照了解过这个的文化...
I didn't think many people would get
all the cultural references.

700
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:42,960
比如，80年代早期，当时曼彻斯特的乐坛
Sort of, Manchester, early '80s,
the whole music scene.

701
01:02:43,034 --> 01:02:44,244
令你十分惊讶
You'd be surprised.

702
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:48,436
但是，很多人没有什么可参照的，因为...
But a lot of people didn't have any kind
of reference to make to it because...

703
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:50,865
虽然，他们知道关于那里的乐队...
They know about the bands over here...

704
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,126
但是，这个...你的角色，和他的电视节目...
but the whole thing, your character,
and his running the TV show...

705
01:02:55,193 --> 01:02:57,015
你想来根烟吗？
Do you want a cigarette?

706
01:02:57,081 --> 01:02:59,895
－抱歉，这是法国的
－没，没事没事，谢谢
- Sorry, they're French.
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

707
01:03:06,137 --> 01:03:07,959
等会儿再抽
I'll save it for later.

708
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:10,863
好吧
Okay.

709
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:23,507
那，劳拉说了...
So, Laura said that...

710
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:29,356
你很迫切的要见我，但她没说是关于什么的
you were really keen to meeting.
She wouldn't tell me what it was.

711
01:03:29,463 --> 01:03:32,975
我不要给你打电话说这些，因为那样听起来很奇怪
I didn't want to say it over the phone
because it would've sounded weird.

712
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:35,915
我能明白劳拉的感觉，非常突然的...
I can imagine how she thought.
This was coming out of nowhere.

713
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:38,161
给她打电话，她也不知道我是谁，可能亚当没告诉她
I phone her up,
and she doesn't know me from Adam.

714
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:40,913
我说“我必须要跟史蒂夫·库根通话”
I said, "I must talk to Steve Coogan."

715
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:42,832
但是我要见到你
But I wanted to see you in person.

716
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,073
后来我发现你会在这里停留几天...
When I found out you'd be here
for a few days...

717
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:47,890
我觉得这是最好的机会告诉你...
I thought this was the perfect opportunity
to let you know...

718
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:50,639
无论如何，闲话少说...
Anyway, I'll get right to it.

719
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:53,675
对关于这个，我相当的激动...
I'm so excited about this.

720
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,588
容我捋一捋... ...
Let me try and put it in context.

721
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,517
我一直非常热衷于历史...
I've always had a big passion for history...

722
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,562
和人文...
and people's lives...

723
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:08,206
我相信，任何小事儿都是遵从A到B的原则...
and all the little events
of how you get from A to B...

724
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:11,693
包括人们生活时的任何小细节...
and all the small details in people's lives...

725
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:15,025
这种小细节满是诗情画意...
that are kind of really full of epic qualities.

726
01:04:15,475 --> 01:04:18,376
我做了很多关于这个的研究...
So I've been doing all this research and...

727
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:22,887
得到了这些...
I've come up with this.

728
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:26,408
到什么阶段了...
已经准备就绪还是要再继续处理你的研究？
And what state is...
Is it greenlit or is it just a treatment?

729
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:28,008
到什么阶段了？
What stage is it?

730
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,657
太对不起了，天呐！这太尴尬了
I'm sorry. God, it's so embarrassing.

731
01:04:31,825 --> 01:04:35,469
这不是...这不是工作
跟工作没有关系...
It's not some... This isn't work.
It's got nothing to do with work.

732
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:37,359
这不是一个“项目”
It's not a project.

733
01:04:37,426 --> 01:04:41,255
我做的是关于血统祖谱的研究，然后我得到...
I did some genealogical research,
and I came across...

734
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:42,957
我发现的就是...
What I discovered was...

735
01:04:43,025 --> 01:04:44,780
－库根先生？
－是我，什么事？
- Mr. Coogan?
- Yes?

736
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:46,474
－真的是你吗？
－是我！
- It is you, isn't it?
- It is, yes.

737
01:04:46,544 --> 01:04:49,642
－我是你庞大的粉丝儿
－你不是那么“庞大”
- I'm such a huge fan.
- You're not that huge.

738
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,683
只在关键部位是。
Only where it counts.

739
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:56,681
－可以麻烦你给我一个签名吗？
－当然，当然
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- Absolutely.

740
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,984
－太棒了～
－已经有人认识我了
- Great.
- I've been recognized.

741
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:01,001
你想签在那儿？
Where do you want it?

742
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:04,803
－纸上就好
－真扫兴
- Paper is fine.
- Spoilsport.

743
01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:08,229
－不，这个不行
－对不起
- No, don't do that.
- Sorry.

744
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:11,236
－我包里可能有
－好吧
- I probably have something in my bag. 
- Okay.

745
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:13,638
给我一秒钟
Just give me a second here.

746
01:05:14,863 --> 01:05:16,073
噢～老天爷
Oh, gosh.

747
01:05:16,494 --> 01:05:18,435
－非常抱歉
－没关系
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

748
01:05:19,725 --> 01:05:22,310
－给我一点时间
－慢慢来
- Give me one more minute.
- Take your time.

749
01:05:22,382 --> 01:05:26,243
－请签在这里
－好的，你的名字是？
- Here, please, in there.
- Okay, and what's your name?

750
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:27,492
凯蒂
Katy.

751
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:30,339
－还有个“Y”
－好的
- With a "Y."
- All right.

752
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:32,613
“那以后凯蒂做什么”
What Katy did next.

753
01:05:33,293 --> 01:05:35,878
－你好
－阿尔弗雷德也是一个艺人
- Hello.
- Alfred's an actor, too.

754
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:40,743
－给你
－谢谢你，太棒了
- Here.
- Thank you. Great.

755
01:05:42,636 --> 01:05:45,123
－非常感谢你
－别客气
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

756
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:53,418
－哇噢～～
－我们继续回到这个
- Wow.
- Let's get back to this.

757
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:56,450
我不想占用你太多的时间，我知道你很忙
I don't want to take up too much
of your time. I know you're busy.

758
01:05:56,555 --> 01:05:59,402
我说到，我做关于血统族谱的...
As I said, I did this genealogical research...

759
01:05:59,499 --> 01:06:03,208
我只要继续做我爱好的事，我没找什么特别的...
I was just doing it for my own interest.
I wasn't looking for anything specific.

760
01:06:03,274 --> 01:06:05,161
我只是偶然发现这一点...
I just came across this.

761
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,995
我不要在废话连篇了...
I'll cut a long story short.

762
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:10,562
史蒂夫·库根
Steve Coogan.

763
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,120
噔噔 噔噔～～～～～～～～
Drum roll.

764
01:06:15,113 --> 01:06:16,901
这意味着，史蒂夫...
The thing is, Steve...

765
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:20,451
你和我是...表亲！！！！
you and I are cousins.

766
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:27,080
你的意思是？是在艺术上是？
How do you mean? You mean artistically?

767
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:32,070
不不，我的意思是，这是最通常的解释...
我们是表亲戚，我们是有关系的...
No, I mean in the normal way.
We're cousins. We're related.

768
01:06:35,528 --> 01:06:38,309
－这太令人惊讶了，是不是？
－对，你确定吗？
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah. Are you sure?

769
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:40,612
就是这样，你看：
The way it works out is, look:

770
01:06:40,967 --> 01:06:43,388
我爷爷的爷爷...
My great-great grandfather...

771
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,238
是你爷爷的叔叔
is your great-great uncle.

772
01:06:46,311 --> 01:06:51,198
之前，我们的爷爷的爷爷的爸爸，就是一个人。
And further back, we shared
the same great-great-great grandfather.

773
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:56,507
我的祖先是爱尔兰，但是我知道应该有一个意大利人...
My ancestry is Irish,
but I knew there was an Italian...

774
01:06:56,582 --> 01:06:58,883
对对，就是。就是因为那个意大利人亲戚是...
That's it. The Italian connection is...

775
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:02,015
爷爷的爷爷的爷爷，他叫朱塞佩
the great-great-great-great grandfather,
Giuseppe.

776
01:07:02,502 --> 01:07:04,989
－这很令人震惊，对吗？
－对，这是...
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yeah, this is...

777
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,848
这是很详细的
This is a lot of detail.

778
01:07:06,918 --> 01:07:10,114
－对，这正是我喜欢的，我只是做一点...
－太令人惊讶了
- It's my thing, I kind of do a little...
- Amazing.

779
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:14,403
我觉得这太棒了，我可以说史蒂夫·库根是我的亲人！ 
I think it's just great to be able to say
that I'm related to Steve Coogan.

780
01:07:14,469 --> 01:07:18,363
我也是，我可以告诉别人我和阿尔伯特·莫里纳沾亲戚 
Likewise, I can tell people
I'm related to Albert Molina.

781
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:19,582
阿尔弗雷德！
Alfred.

782
01:07:22,884 --> 01:07:26,047
这是我奶奶，她在家谱里份量可不轻...
It's my grandmother who's the big one
on the family tree.

783
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:27,490
她一定非常的兴奋！
She'll be very thrilled.

784
01:07:27,555 --> 01:07:30,871
她也是你庞大的粉丝儿，她喜欢你在...
She's a huge fan of your work.
She loved you in...

785
01:07:33,923 --> 01:07:35,133
《不羁夜》的表演。
Boogie Nights.

786
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:37,623
真的？那个在里面穿裤衩举枪的那个？
Right. With the shorts and the shotgun?

787
01:07:37,731 --> 01:07:40,032
对，她提起过一次关于那个电影
Yeah, she talked about that once.

788
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:41,855
太好了
Great.

789
01:07:41,954 --> 01:07:45,848
我知道这是很突然的，但是你想想我们是表亲的可能性有多大？
I know this is coming right out of the blue,
but just think of the possibilities.

790
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:48,191
这太神奇了不是吗？你看...
It's fantastic. Let's look at the facts.

791
01:07:48,258 --> 01:07:52,480
我们都是艺人，我们是表亲，我们已经证明了这一切
We're both actors.
We're cousins, we've established that.

792
01:07:53,442 --> 01:07:56,507
也许我们可以一起工作，比如演戏...
We could maybe work together,
do a play maybe.

793
01:07:56,578 --> 01:07:58,617
或许我们一起拍个电影...
We could make a movie.

794
01:07:58,689 --> 01:08:01,274
我们可以拍一个，关于这个故事...
We could actually do a movie
about this story.

795
01:08:01,345 --> 01:08:04,661
关于发现，我们这了不起的关系，我们是表兄弟啊～～～
About discovering this amazing thing
between us, that we're cousins.

796
01:08:04,769 --> 01:08:06,656
比如，这故事要两个演员...
The story could be two actors...

797
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:10,517
他们发现他们竟然是表亲，那我们可以自导自演啊...
who discover that they're cousins.
We can actually play ourselves.

798
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:14,236
我们在电影里，我是弗雷德·莫里纳，你是史蒂夫...
We'd be in the movie.
I'd be Fred Molina, you'd be Steve...

799
01:08:14,304 --> 01:08:16,725
我们在电影里是表亲！！！！
We'd be cousins in the movie.

800
01:08:17,728 --> 01:08:21,023
这实在太棒了！实在太美妙了～
It's fantastic. It'd be great, absolutely great.

801
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:26,810
你知道，也许不拍，我们可以一起出街...
You know, or not. We could just hang out.

802
01:08:26,943 --> 01:08:30,074
我们或许有时候一起喝个啤酒什么的，还不错
We should definitely go
for a beer sometime. That'd be great.

803
01:08:30,142 --> 01:08:33,916
也许，我们一起去旅游，我们两个人...
Maybe go on vacation together,
just the two of us...

804
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:36,632
可以更加相互了解...
sort of get to know each other.

805
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:44,539
你不是同志是吗？你不是
You're not gay are you?

806
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:46,130
不是
No.

807
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:48,245
不，我已经结婚了
No, I'm married.

808
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:50,264
詹姆斯一世也是这样
So was James I.

809
01:08:51,133 --> 01:08:54,394
对不起，我不知道，这是我突然感觉到的
Sorry. I don't know,
that just popped into my head.

810
01:08:54,461 --> 01:08:57,330
－随口一问，为了避免尴尬
－嗯，我明白
- Say it, get it out of the way.
- I understand.

811
01:08:57,821 --> 01:08:59,315
我明白你是怎么想的...
I know exactly what you're thinking.

812
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:01,657
如果有一天突然来个人对我说“我是你的表亲”...
If somebody came up to me going,
"I'm your cousin"...

813
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:03,828
我也觉得这人脑子不好...
I'd think they were a nutter as well.

814
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,394
认真的讲，我真的没有疯...
Take it from me, I'm not crazy.

815
01:09:05,468 --> 01:09:09,722
我只觉得这是好的出奇的......
I just think
this is a fantastic, extraordinary...

816
01:09:10,332 --> 01:09:12,720
－对我来说是非常愉快的
－当然
- delightful thing for me.
- Absolutely.

817
01:09:12,828 --> 01:09:15,445
－我只是想让你知道这些...
－嗯嗯嗯
- And I just wanted you to know about it.
- Ditto.

818
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:18,039
我只要，如果我想要什么...
All I want, if I want anything...

819
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:22,579
只要你承认这好的出奇的关系...
is for you to just acknowledge
this extraordinary thing...

820
01:09:25,082 --> 01:09:27,121
和爱我
and just love me.

821
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,136
嗯哼～可以
Yeah, I could do that.

822
01:09:48,473 --> 01:09:51,953
我得走了
I have to go.

823
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:56,077
还没告诉你，我还有个见面会
I didn't tell you. I have this meeting.

824
01:09:56,248 --> 01:09:58,255
－其实时间已经调前了
－啊～～
- It actually moved forward.
- I see.

825
01:09:58,328 --> 01:10:02,418
是在环球，会计和投资商这类...
It's at Universal.
Number crunchers, financiers...

826
01:10:09,911 --> 01:10:11,437
－这...
－这是给你的
- This...
- That's for you.

827
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:13,451
－噢～不错
－是你的
- That's great.
- It's yours.

828
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:19,153
－我会放到我的资料柜里
－当然
- I'll make sure that gets filed.
- Sure.

829
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:22,123
你还要在这几天，对吗？
You'll be here a couple of days, right?

830
01:10:22,197 --> 01:10:24,782
也许你临走前我们可以再见一面...
So maybe we could see each other
before you go.

831
01:10:25,878 --> 01:10:28,212
只要确认一下我的日程...
Just checking the mental diary...

832
01:10:33,557 --> 01:10:37,353
情况不太好，在这里的时间...
This is not good, the time I'm here.

833
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:39,628
－已经满满当当的了
－我明白我明白
- It's just that it's packed.
- I understand.

834
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,714
没问题
No problem.

835
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:44,497
给我你的手机号儿走之前我给你打电话
Give me your cell phone number,
and I'll call you before you go.

836
01:10:44,564 --> 01:10:46,254
这有个插曲...
There's a story there.

837
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:49,358
在美国的运营商的信号...
There's a tri-band system
here in the States...

838
01:10:49,427 --> 01:10:52,274
和英国的不一样...
which is different to the system in the UK...

839
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:54,159
是一种...
and it's a kind of...

840
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:58,505
我们的手机拿到这里用不了，所以，我是没有手机的...
The cell phones, they don't work here.
So I'm kind of cell phone-less...

841
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:00,651
－在美国
－我了解
- in the US.
- I see.

842
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:04,234
那给我你的座机号码也行，我给你打
Well, give me your home number.
I'll call you.

843
01:11:04,307 --> 01:11:06,379
－你有我助理的号码不是么？
－对
- You've got my PA's number, right?
- Yeah.

844
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:08,523
很好，我们可以这样联络
Great, then we're connected.

845
01:11:08,786 --> 01:11:11,403
你不能给我你家的电话号码吗？
Can't you give me your number at home?

846
01:11:14,098 --> 01:11:15,526
我能说不吗？
Can I say no?

847
01:11:15,986 --> 01:11:20,622
因为，这不是针对你的...
Because nothing,
absolutely nothing personal...

848
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:25,358
只是我从来没给别人我的号码，从未...
It's just that I never
give my number out, ever.

849
01:11:25,425 --> 01:11:27,366
这是我的隐私...
It's just a personal space thing.

850
01:11:27,441 --> 01:11:31,499
这是一个规则...我常对自己说“坚持规则”
It's just a rule and I always think,
"Stick to the rule."

851
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,825
其实更好称之为理论而不是规则...
It's more of a philosophy than a rule.

852
01:11:37,872 --> 01:11:41,646
有很多名人我都没有给...
I've not given my number out
to many eminent people in the past.

853
01:11:41,712 --> 01:11:44,013
有一次山姆·曼德斯问我要，我都没给
I once didn't give my number
to Sam Mendes.

854
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,989
所以你们是并列的...
So you're in good company.

855
01:11:48,463 --> 01:11:51,975
如果山姆·曼德斯都觉得好的话
对我也是
If it's good enough for Sam Mendes,
it's good enough for me.

856
01:11:57,294 --> 01:12:00,195
－我觉得是我的
－对对对，我的不能用
- I think it's me.
- Right, because mine doesn't work.

857
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,887
失陪，我得接个电话...很快回来
I'm sorry, I got to take this. I'll get back.

858
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:04,642
你好？
Hello?

859
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:07,435
是，当然
Yeah, sure.

860
01:12:09,646 --> 01:12:12,842
斯派克，嗨，你怎么样？
Spike, hi. How you doing?

861
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:15,017
你收到信息了
You got the message.

862
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:19,175
我经纪人给你打电话确认过我们说的是一样
My agent just called you just to make sure
we're all on the same page.

863
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:24,583
不，我们都是制片人，因为这样可以确保无误
No, the producer credit is just so you and I
can sort of keep tabs on everything.

864
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:26,855
你知道，要确保表演的完整性什么的...
You know, artistic integrity,
that sort of thing.

865
01:12:26,924 --> 01:12:29,771
要不然的话，很可能功亏一篑
Otherwise the whole thing
could just run away.

866
01:12:32,588 --> 01:12:34,562
你啊你！不
You bastard, no.

867
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:36,674
好吧
All right.

868
01:12:36,747 --> 01:12:39,430
那还是周日？好，好的
You still okay for Sunday? Good. All right.

869
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:42,346
我在那儿见你吗？
好，好，尽早
Will I meet you there?
All right. Nice and early.

870
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:45,574
好的，对，哥们儿，拜，斯派克
Okay, yeah. Lots of love. Bye, Spike.

871
01:12:47,018 --> 01:12:49,472
－很抱歉
－噢，没事儿
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, fine.

872
01:12:52,874 --> 01:12:54,913
是斯派克·李吗？
Was that Spike Lee?

873
01:12:55,018 --> 01:12:59,011
不，我不认识斯派克·李
是斯派克·琼斯
No. I don't even know Spike Lee.
That was Spike Jonze.

874
01:13:00,778 --> 01:13:03,494
－我很崇拜他
－对，他是个好人
- I love him.
- Yeah, he's a good man.

875
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:07,172
我们是老朋友
We've been friends for a long time now.

876
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:09,505
我们都喜欢户外远足
We're both keen hikers.

877
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:12,612
－这没什么可说的
－不，继续
- Well, it's very boring.
- No, go on.

878
01:13:13,064 --> 01:13:17,057
我们在同一个户外俱乐部，周末常去远足
We belong to a club,
and we go hiking at weekends.

879
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:21,408
他是一个非常坚定的环保主义者
He's a very committed environmentalist.

880
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:25,566
斯派克·琼斯是个环境保护狂
天呐，之前真不知道他这么缺...
Spike Jonze is a tree-hugger.
Jesus, I never had him down as that.

881
01:13:29,319 --> 01:13:32,352
我认为，或许他更喜欢你称他为“叶人”
I think he prefers the term "leaf people"...

882
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,533
我也是
as do I.

883
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:41,628
嗯，我的意思是，这个...
别误会，这很好
Right, I mean, that's...
Don't get me wrong. That's great.

884
01:13:42,694 --> 01:13:46,687
我喜爱树，我觉得应该有更多的树
I love trees.
I think there should be more of them.

885
01:13:47,877 --> 01:13:50,298
用纸的时候两面都用
When I use paper, I use both sides.

886
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:53,503
我很乐意...
I would love to...

887
01:13:58,853 --> 01:14:01,470
你知道，我要撤销那个...
You know, I'm going to tear up...

888
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:04,769
关于电话号码的那个白痴规则
that stupid rule about phone numbers.

889
01:14:05,668 --> 01:14:07,260
太他妈缺了
It's such shit.

890
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:12,543
如果现在再给你我的电话号码，你是不是觉得我很差劲？
Would it be shabby of me
to give you my number now?

891
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:16,504
是
Yeah.

892
01:14:26,115 --> 01:14:28,602
我得走了，很抱歉
I've got to go. I'm so sorry.

893
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:33,470
－我会结帐的
－好
- I'll get the check.
- Good.

894
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:47,833
操
Fuck.

895
01:15:03,742 --> 01:15:06,163
谵妄

895
01:15:23,742 --> 01:15:26,163
该死的RZA，你他妈干啥呢？
Damn RZA. Where the fuck you at?

896
01:15:38,653 --> 01:15:40,856
－呦～我的瓷
－鲍比
- Yo, peace.
- Bobby.

897
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,427
－不好意思我迟到了
－没事儿
- Pardon me for being late.
- Ain't nothing.

898
01:15:46,493 --> 01:15:50,387
－刚才想电你来着
－我刚才有个他妈的急诊
- I was about to hit you on the horn.
- I had a fucking emergency house call, yo.

899
01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:52,662
－一个家庭急诊？
－嗯，一个家庭急诊
- A house call?
- Yeah, a house call.

900
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:56,986
索菲亚和师傅的孩子病了，流感
Sophia and Sifu's children got sick
with the flu and the virus.

901
01:15:57,339 --> 01:16:00,240
我去给他们配了副药
So I went by,
prescribed some herbal medicines for them.

902
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:03,543
我告诉他们，别吃乳制品，少吃果酸...
I told them, lay off the dairy products,
chill on the citric acid...

903
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,747
这样才能好的更快
and they should feel a little better.

904
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,744
－那你是医生还是？
－对，我告诉你了
- So you a doctor now, or something?
- Yeah, I told you.

905
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:12,784
我学自然疗法已经两年了，孙儿
I've been studying alternative medicine
for two years now, son.

906
01:16:12,858 --> 01:16:15,825
就是，古老的传统疗法这类...
I mean, ancient healing techniques,
and all that.

907
01:16:15,898 --> 01:16:17,043
你看
Check this.

908
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:21,237
我能用钻枪做一种手术...
I even know a certain surgical procedure
that I can perform using a drill-gun.

909
01:16:21,433 --> 01:16:22,839
电钻
Electric drill-gun.

910
01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:24,790
绝对不是闹着玩
I'm dead serious.

911
01:16:24,857 --> 01:16:28,239
因为我有一双DJ手，所以更灵活利落...
明白吗？
But my hands are nice from being a DJ,
you know what I mean?

912
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:31,127
对我来说音乐和医术都是在一起的...
To me, music and medicine, all go together.

913
01:16:31,193 --> 01:16:33,581
就像两个行星围绕着一个太阳...
It's like two planets
revolving around the same sun.

914
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:34,703
意思很对
So bong-bong.

915
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:36,466
－你要茶不？
－要，满上
- Want some tea?
- Yeah, splash me.

916
01:16:36,568 --> 01:16:38,739
是自然草叶，瓷，没有咖啡因
It's all herbals, man. No caffeine.

917
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,701
正合我意，没有咖啡因
那东西太2B了对么，我的瓷
That's what I'm talking about. No caffeine.
Caffeine is ridiculous right now, man.

918
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:44,269
挺你
Tell me about it.

919
01:16:44,376 --> 01:16:47,059
咖啡因能让你变的消沉...
Caffeine leads to depression...

920
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,579
变得易怒，加速你的心跳...
makes you all irritable,
have your heart beating fast.

921
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:52,469
加快心率，你懂么？
Faster heart rate, you know what I mean?

922
01:16:52,535 --> 01:16:55,917
最操蛋的是，喝了就会拉粑粑...
And worse than anything,
you drink that coffee, it gives you the shits.

923
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:59,187
你懂吗？所以我不碰那玩意...
You know what I mean?
So I try to stay away from that.

924
01:16:59,254 --> 01:17:02,668
－无论如何"滴咖啡不沾"
－没有咖啡因，更加清爽干净
- I'm off that shit, anyway.
- Crisp and clean. No caffeine.

925
01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:06,900
－为《液体剑》干杯，我的亲
－不，为“数码鲍比”干杯
- To Liquid Swords, family.
- No, to Bobby Digital.

926
01:17:06,966 --> 01:17:09,332
－武当万岁
－武当万岁
- Wu-Tang forever.
- Wu-Tang forever.

927
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,979
你们来点咖啡吗？
Anybody need more coffee?

928
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,532
－厨房快下班了
－不，我们才不要碰咖啡因...
- Kitchen's closing.
- No, we don't mess with caffeine.

929
01:17:15,637 --> 01:17:17,524
－真不？
－绝不！
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

930
01:17:17,877 --> 01:17:20,298
你知道咖啡因会让你产生严重的谵妄状态吗？
Don't you know caffeine
can cause serious delirium?

931
01:17:20,372 --> 01:17:22,444
－谵妄？
－严重的谵妄！
- Delirium?
- Serious delirium.

932
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:24,077
那你现在才说
Now you tell me.

933
01:17:25,013 --> 01:17:27,314
哇噢，那有可能这是我的问题，谵妄
Well, that may be my problem, delirium.

934
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,674
你是不是比尔·莫瑞？伙计
Aren't you Bill Murray, man?

935
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:37,226
－你是比尔·莫瑞？
－对，我是比尔·莫瑞...
- You're Bill Murray?
- Yeah, I'm Bill Murray...

936
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:40,168
但是别声张，好么？
but let's keep that just between us, all right?

937
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:43,153
我们知道就行
Just between us.

938
01:17:45,363 --> 01:17:48,112
你们是亲人吗？
And you guys are related?

939
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:50,792
对，我们是表兄弟，我们是亲人！
Yeah, we're cousins. We're family.

940
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:54,182
不，你们逗我玩呢，因为你俩都是捣蛋鬼...
No, you're messing with me
because you're both troublemakers.

941
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:57,190
－捣蛋鬼？
－“武当帮”
- Troublemakers?
- The Wu-Tang Clan.

942
01:17:57,266 --> 01:17:58,924
对，“武当帮”
Right, Wu-Tang Clan.

943
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:01,806
－你是神童GZA
－正是
- You're GZA, the genius.
- That's right.

944
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:04,393
－然后，你是RZA...
－称号...
- And you're RZA...
- A.k. A...

945
01:18:06,225 --> 01:18:09,541
－数码鲍比
－耶～他懂黑泡～
- Bobby Digital.
- Yeah, he knows hip-hop.

946
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:11,439
那你是比尔·莫瑞
And you're Bill Murray.

947
01:18:11,825 --> 01:18:15,883
“今天暂时停止和捉鬼”的比尔·莫瑞
Bill "Groundhog Day,
Ghostbusting ass" Murray.

948
01:18:15,985 --> 01:18:19,018
－“你想叫谁？”
－嗯嗯，但是别和别人说...
- "Who ya gonna call?"
- I know that. Just don't tell anybody.

949
01:18:19,088 --> 01:18:21,324
为什么？比尔·莫瑞
What you mean, don't tell anybody,
Bill Murray?

950
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:24,839
谁来这都能认出来，你是比尔·莫瑞，这太明显了！！！
People will come here, they'll see you.
You're Bill Murray. It's obvious.

951
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,367
也许你想隐瞒这一点...
Unless you're wearing a disguise
or something.

952
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:30,372
对我就这么做的...
I am wearing kind of a disguise.

953
01:18:32,271 --> 01:18:34,212
该死的，这太苛刻了...
Damn, that's harsh, money.

954
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:38,312
－你真的是一个咖啡因痴，对吗？
－嘘～～～，就我们知道...
- You're a real caffeine junkie, aren't you?
- Keep it down. Just between us.

955
01:18:38,382 --> 01:18:39,810
来干杯！
Here, cheers.

956
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:49,221
你知道，我戒咖啡之前...
You know, before I gave that up...

957
01:18:49,326 --> 01:18:52,391
我每天晚上都喝...
I used to drink it every single night...

958
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:56,291
到睡觉的时候...这样，梦就会更快更有趣儿...
up until it was time to go to sleep.
Used to make me dream faster.

959
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:59,877
你知道，就像印地500赛车里的摄像机...
You know, like when they flash
those cameras on those Indy 500 cars...

960
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:03,573
它们就是...
嗖～嗖～嗖～嗖～嗖～嗖～嗖～嗖～
and they just...

961
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:07,685
我就会做这样的梦，就一直这样
That's how my dreams were.
Just whizzing by.

962
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:10,697
－你可真缺啊
－他挺缺，是不？
- You're stupid, yo.
- He is stupid, isn't he?

963
01:19:10,892 --> 01:19:12,168
很缺～～
Word, yo.

964
01:19:16,075 --> 01:19:18,311
我认识一哥们儿，他做咖啡冰块儿...
I know a guy who freezes coffee.

965
01:19:19,115 --> 01:19:21,962
咖啡倒在模子里放上小棍儿，做成咖啡棒冰...
Puts sticks in it,
has himself a coffee Popsicle.

966
01:19:22,027 --> 01:19:24,034
咖棒！！！
A caf pop.

967
01:19:28,714 --> 01:19:31,747
该死，你听起来不太好，比尔·莫瑞
Damn. That don't sound too good,
Bill Murray.

968
01:19:31,819 --> 01:19:35,167
别着急，不是感冒了，只是因为抽烟...
It's not the flu or anything.
It's just a smoker's cough.

969
01:19:37,226 --> 01:19:41,448
这就是我的意思，就是因为尼古丁会影响中枢神经系统...
That's what I'm saying, nicotine interferes
with your central nervous system...

970
01:19:41,514 --> 01:19:43,336
你的呼吸系统...
your respiratorial system.

971
01:19:43,401 --> 01:19:46,783
只要一点就会麻痹...
In very small doses, it causes paralysis.

972
01:19:50,921 --> 01:19:53,255
－真的？
－对，真的，伙计
- Really?
- Yeah, really, man.

973
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,687
只要50微克...
I mean, just 50 mg alone...

974
01:19:56,232 --> 01:19:58,598
证实数分钟内足以致死...
have been proven to be fatal
in a few minutes.

975
01:19:58,664 --> 01:20:01,184
－一根儿烟有多少？
－3微克
- How much is in one cigarette?
- 3 mg.

976
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,574
还有，你知道，尼古丁是用做来杀虫剂的...
And did you know
they also use nicotine for insecticide...

977
01:20:04,648 --> 01:20:07,681
－就是杀虫的？
－如果用来杀虫应该是好的，不是吗？
- to kill bugs?
- It's good if it kills bugs, right?

978
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,103
你是一个虫子吗？比尔·莫瑞
Are you a bug, Bill Murray?

979
01:20:13,127 --> 01:20:16,192
－天呐，RZA，你听起来就像是我的医生
－他就是医生！
- Jesus, RZA, you sound like my doctor.
- He is a doctor.

980
01:20:16,551 --> 01:20:19,867
其实他专业是自然疗法...
Actually, he specializes
in alternative medicine.

981
01:20:20,294 --> 01:20:22,748
就是，另一个星球的疗法...
That is, alternative to this planet.

982
01:20:26,758 --> 01:20:30,914
帮个忙给点面子...别让其他人知道我在这，好吗？
Do me a favor and don't tell anybody
you saw me here, okay?

983
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:33,564
你可以信任我们，比尔·莫瑞
You can trust us, Bill Murray.

984
01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:40,221
－你是在隐居还是？
－对，差不多这样...
- You hiding out or something?
- Yeah, sort of, something like that.

985
01:20:41,956 --> 01:20:43,897
但我觉得，我现在可能是谵妄的状态...
Now I'm thinking it may be delirium.

986
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:45,980
－严重的谵妄状态...
－极其严重的...
- Serious delirium.
- Serious.

987
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:50,809
如果你想低调一些，我这有点东西可以帮助你...
If you're on the low, I got something
that'll help you with your disguise.

988
01:20:51,396 --> 01:20:52,824
给你
Take this.

989
01:20:53,604 --> 01:20:55,327
－你随便怎么用
－天呐...
- Use whatever you want.
- Jeez.

990
01:20:55,428 --> 01:20:59,137
－对，可以低调点...
－你不必这么客气，这太好了
- Rock that, man. Stay on the low.
- You didn't have to do this. This is great.

991
01:20:59,203 --> 01:21:00,664
这包东西都给你，比尔
A bag of items for you, Bill.

992
01:21:00,771 --> 01:21:02,559
－谢谢
－没关系
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

993
01:21:02,627 --> 01:21:04,317
我很感激...
I really appreciate this.

994
01:21:06,275 --> 01:21:07,485
这太好了！
This is great.

995
01:21:09,538 --> 01:21:11,479
先生，我该怎么治我的咳嗽？
Doc, what could I do for this cough?

996
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:14,140
对，刚才我想到了，你看...
I was just thinking about that.
Check this out.

997
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:17,983
－你拿点双氧水儿
－我们这里有
- You get some hydrogen peroxide.
- We got that for cuts and stuff.

998
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:21,310
一半水一半双氧水
Take 50% hydrogen peroxide, 50% water.

999
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:24,028
用它来漱口，别喝下去，得吐出来...
You gargle with it.
Do not swallow, you spit it out.

1000
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,536
千万别喝啊～比尔·莫瑞
Don't swallow, Bill Murray.

1001
01:21:25,602 --> 01:21:28,471
如果这样不好使，你换成除油清洁剂试试...
And if that doesn't work, try oven cleaner.

1002
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:31,737
那个后面也有...
I got that in the back, too.

1003
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:33,756
－谢谢你
－酷！～～～～
- Thank you.
- Cool.

1004
01:21:33,825 --> 01:21:36,508
谢谢，那我现在去试试去...
Thank you. I'm going to try it right now.

1005
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:40,535
－好的
－遵命，瓷
- Word.
- Word, man.

1006
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,358
－比尔·他妈的·莫瑞
－太疯狂了～～～
- Bill motherfucking Murray.
- It's crazy, yo.

1007
01:21:46,015 --> 01:21:47,705
－3点了
－怎么了？
- 3:00.
- What's up?

1008
01:21:47,872 --> 01:21:50,359
我告诉“幽灵”三点来这...
I told Ghost to be here by 3:00 a.m.

1009
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:53,627
别抱太大期望，你知道等他的结果是什么样...
Don't hold your breath on that.
You know how it is waiting on Ghost.

1010
01:21:53,695 --> 01:21:56,564
－说不定要等一晚上...
－你觉得我们呼点叶子怎么样？
- We'll be here all night.
- Think we can smoke a blunt up here?

1011
01:21:56,671 --> 01:22:00,412
－这儿太热闹可能不太安全...
－但是，我们之前在这呼过啊
- It's hot up in here with the 5-0.
- But we used to always smoke weed in here.

1012
01:22:00,478 --> 01:22:03,161
但那是“脏狗”出事儿之前的事儿...
That was until Dirt Dog done blew it up.

1013
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:06,165
告诉达夫龙，别让“脏”来这儿
Told Deflon,
"Never let Dirty inside this spot, man."

1014
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:08,060
那怎么了？你想怎么弄？
So what's up? What you want to do?

1015
01:22:08,126 --> 01:22:10,492
－我们去棚里吧
－成，棚里
- Yo, let's slide to the 'udio.
- Hit the 'udio, right.

1016
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,532
下棋吗？好，那儿
Play some chess? All right, then.

1017
01:22:12,605 --> 01:22:16,182
－找莫瑞结帐？
－他不差钱儿
- Is that the bill for Murray?
- He don't need no money, yo.

1018
01:22:16,253 --> 01:22:18,870
－还是给他吧
－用不用给小费？
- Hit him, anyway.
- Think I should tip him?

1019
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:26,745
－你觉得他真用清洁剂漱口呢么？
－我不知道，但是咱俩赶紧撤吧！
- You think he's using the oven cleaner?
- Don't know, but let's get the fuck out.

1020
01:22:43,354 --> 01:22:47,241
香槟酒

1020
01:22:51,354 --> 01:22:53,241
你还好吗？泰勒
Are you all right, Taylor?

1021
01:22:55,866 --> 01:22:58,680
－不太好
－怎么了？
- No, not really.
- What's up?

1022
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:04,663
我不知道，我感觉我与这个世界分离...
I don't know.
I feel so divorced from the world.

1023
01:23:05,497 --> 01:23:07,700
我与这个世界失去联系...
I've lost touch with the world.

1024
01:23:09,081 --> 01:23:11,830
你知道马勒的那首歌...
Do you know that song by Mahler...

1025
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:16,557
－《我被这个世界遗忘》
－没
- I've Lost Track of the World?
- No.

1026
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:21,037
这是一个非常优美...
It's one of the most beautiful...

1027
01:23:21,112 --> 01:23:23,533
和非常悲伤的一首歌...
and saddest songs ever written.

1028
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:29,484
我耳边好像有人吟唱...
I can almost hear it now.

1029
01:23:34,967 --> 01:23:36,461
你能听到吗？
Can you hear it?

1030
01:24:26,803 --> 01:24:28,231
啊～现在没了
It's gone now.

1031
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:31,760
－但是你听到了吗？
－好像听到了
- But did you hear it?
- I think so.

1032
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:38,507
声音的共振...在整个楼里...
It resonated
right through the whole building.

1033
01:24:40,594 --> 01:24:43,310
－我们在哪儿？
－我们在军械库，泰勒
- Where are we?
- In the armory, Taylor.

1034
01:24:45,073 --> 01:24:47,014
“军械库，泰勒”
"The armory, Taylor."

1035
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:52,871
听起来很沉闷
It sounds so heavy and ponderous.

1036
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:55,849
“军械库”
"The armory."

1037
01:24:57,296 --> 01:25:00,077
尼古拉·特斯拉...
Nikola Tesla...

1038
01:25:01,488 --> 01:25:04,804
感知到地球是声音共振的...
perceived the Earth as a conductor...

1039
01:25:05,488 --> 01:25:08,619
导体...
of acoustical resonance.

1040
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:14,730
我真的不明白你想说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1041
01:25:16,975 --> 01:25:18,884
你能解释一下吗？
Can you explain it to me?

1042
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:21,639
－不，不行
－好吧
- No, not really.
- I know.

1043
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:25,037
让我们以咖啡代香槟...
Let's pretend this coffee is champagne.

1044
01:25:26,926 --> 01:25:28,681
为什么要这样？
Why would we do that?

1045
01:25:29,326 --> 01:25:31,398
哇噢～让我们感受赞扬生命
Well, to celebrate life.

1046
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:36,041
你知道，像有钱有品味的人...
You know, like the rich, elegant people do.

1047

那些豪绅们...

1048
01:25:40,205 --> 01:25:44,066
我比较喜欢咖啡，简单的，亲民的咖啡...
I prefer coffee.
Simple, working man's coffee.

1049
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:50,726
你真是个土老冒，比尔
你知道你的问题是什么吗？
You're so provincial, Bill.
Do you know what your problem is?

1050
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:53,250
是什么？
What?

1051
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:58,664
你没有生活乐趣
You have no joie de vivre.

1052
01:26:00,811 --> 01:26:01,988
当真？
I don't?

1053
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:07,073
真的，而且，这个咖啡很烂
No. Besides, this coffee is awful.

1054
01:26:09,579 --> 01:26:12,993
－对，真的不好，是不是？
－糟透了
- You're right. It really is bad, isn't it?
- Dreadful.

1055
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:16,193
让我们举杯～
I propose a toast.

1056
01:26:17,515 --> 01:26:19,402
为了什么举杯？
So what should we toast?

1057
01:26:22,506 --> 01:26:25,637
为了20年代的巴黎！
Paris in the 1920s.

1058
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:28,677
约瑟芬·贝克，红磨坊
Josephine Baker, the Moulin Rouge.

1059
01:26:29,321 --> 01:26:31,360
“怎么样，好吗？”
"What is it? Okay?"

1060
01:26:32,905 --> 01:26:34,213
也为...
And also...

1061
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:37,472
70年代的纽约...

1063
01:26:40,553 --> 01:26:42,375
真的？好吧
Really? All right.

1064
01:26:42,985 --> 01:26:44,740
干杯
Cheers.

1065
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:51,777
味道好极了，是不是？
Delicious, isn't it?

1066
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:57,115
香槟酒：来自神的甘露
Champagne: Nectar of the gods.

1067
01:26:58,727 --> 01:27:01,858
这就是你的午饭？咖啡和一根烟？
Is that all you're having for lunch,
coffee and a cigarette?

1068
01:27:01,927 --> 01:27:03,617
这不太健康
It's not very healthy.

1069
01:27:05,255 --> 01:27:06,978
我们已经吃了午饭
We had lunch earlier.

1070
01:27:10,278 --> 01:27:11,455
吃了吗？
We did?

1071
01:27:12,997 --> 01:27:17,022
我们现在在休息，喝咖啡
We're on a break here, a coffee break.

1072
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:20,352
多压抑啊～
How depressing.

1073
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,676
我们要休息多久？
How long is our break, anyway?

1074
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:27,009
10分钟左右，但是快结束了
About 10 minutes, and it's nearly over now.

1075
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:32,671
告诉我这不是真的
Say it isn't true.

1076
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,209
－啊？
－什么？
- Well?
- What?

1077
01:27:38,372 --> 01:27:41,088
我说你要告诉我这不是真的
I asked you to say it isn't true.

1078
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:43,326
说什么不是真的？
Say what isn't true?

1079
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:46,941
算了！
Never mind.

1080
01:27:48,771 --> 01:27:50,875
那我要打个盹儿
Anyway, I have to have a nap.

1081
01:27:53,283 --> 01:27:56,697
那休息结束时你叫我
So call me when the break is over.

1082
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:03,737
那，你还有不到两分钟的盹儿
Well, you have two minutes or less
for your nap.

1083
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:44,926
现在，新闻！
And now, the news.
